A task has been marked as completed. You MUST now:

1. Launch the game to verify the implementation
2. Take screenshots proving functionality
3. Check for errors in the console output
4. Generate a test report

Use the godot-tester agent to perform verification:
claude-chat godot-tester "Verify the completed task: $TASK_DESC"

Testing is MANDATORY before proceeding to the next task.
