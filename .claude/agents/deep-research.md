patterns = [
    "**/*.gd",        # All GDScript files
    "**/*.tscn",      # All scenes
    "**/*.tres",      # All resources
    "**/project.godot" # Project settings
]

for pattern in patterns:
    files = Glob(pattern)
    analyze_files(files)
```

### Pattern Detection
```python
# Find specific patterns
searches = [
    "signal.*emit",           # Signal usage
    "extends.*",              # Inheritance patterns
    "@export.*",              # Exported variables
    "func _ready",            # Lifecycle methods
    "get_node|\\$",          # Node access patterns
]

for search in searches:
    results = Grep(search, "**/*.gd")
    analyze_pattern(results)
```
