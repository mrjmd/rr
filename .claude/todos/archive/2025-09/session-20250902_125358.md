# Rando's Reservoir - Current Session TODOs
*Last Updated: 2025-09-02 18:35*
*Session Started: [NEW SESSION READY]*
*Project Phase: MVP DEVELOPMENT*

## üöÄ Current Sprint Goal
**MVP CORE MECHANIC**: Implement baby pickup/putdown and fuss meter system

## üéØ CONTEXT FOR NEXT AGENT

### üèÜ POC COMPLETION SUMMARY (VERIFIED SUCCESS)
**THE POC IS COMPLETE AND FULLY WORKING:**
- ‚úÖ Kitchen scene with player movement (WASD controls)
- ‚úÖ ESC pause menu integration (tested and working)
- ‚úÖ Main menu integration (Start Game button connects to kitchen)
- ‚úÖ Scene transitions (kitchen ‚Üî main menu working)
- ‚úÖ Screenshot verification completed (F9 system working)
- ‚úÖ No console errors during gameplay

**Files in place and working:**
- `src/scenes/poc/kitchen.tscn` - Kitchen scene with player controller
- `src/scripts/poc/player_controller.gd` - WASD movement implementation

### üöÄ READY FOR MVP DEVELOPMENT
**You are implementing the innovative baby management mechanic:**
The core concept is proven. Build the gameplay that makes caring for a baby while doing adult tasks challenging and interesting.

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Max 1 item)
*No tasks in progress - ready for next agent to begin*

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED PREVIOUS SESSION
- [x] POC kitchen scene implementation and verification
- [x] Player movement controller with WASD controls  
- [x] ESC pause menu integration
- [x] Main menu Start Game button connection
- [x] Screenshot verification of all functionality
- [x] Project cleanup and handoff documentation
- [x] Created /temp/ directory for temporary files
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md with temp directory protocol

## üìã MVP DEVELOPMENT PLAN (Start Here)

### üéØ IMMEDIATE TASKS (Week 1 - Core Mechanic)
1. [ ] Add baby sprite to kitchen scene
   - Location: Position baby in crib/safe area of kitchen
   - Purpose: Visual foundation for pickup interaction
   - Test: Verify scene still runs with new sprite

2. [ ] Implement spacebar pickup/putdown mechanic
   - Interaction: Player approaches baby, spacebar to pick up/put down  
   - State: Baby follows player when carried, crib when put down
   - Logic: Track carrying/not-carrying state in player controller

3. [ ] Add fuss meter UI element
   - UI: Progress bar showing baby's contentment level
   - Logic: Decreases over time when baby is left alone
   - Visual: Clear indication of baby's emotional state

4. [ ] Add coffee-making interaction point
   - Location: Designated coffee machine area in kitchen
   - Interaction: Press spacebar to make coffee (takes time)
   - Conflict: Can't make coffee while holding baby

5. [ ] Add frustration meter for player
   - UI: Second progress bar showing player stress
   - Logic: Increases when tasks are blocked by baby needs
   - Balance: Core tension between baby care and personal tasks

### üèÜ MVP WIN/LOSE CONDITIONS
6. [ ] Implement basic win/lose states
   - Win: Keep both meters balanced for 2 minutes
   - Lose: Either meter reaches critical level
   - Feedback: Clear game over screen with results

### üé® POLISH TASKS (After Core Works)
7. [ ] Replace player icon.svg with actual character sprite
8. [ ] Add baby sprite animations (idle, fussing, content)
9. [ ] Add kitchen furniture sprites for visual atmosphere
10. [ ] Polish movement feel and collision detection

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### What You're Building
- **Innovation**: Baby management mechanic - caring for baby while trying to accomplish adult tasks
- **Core Conflict**: Can't do everything at once - must choose between baby care and personal needs
- **Gameplay Loop**: Pick up baby ‚Üí baby happy, can't make coffee ‚Üí put down baby ‚Üí make coffee ‚Üí baby gets fussy ‚Üí repeat

### Technical Foundation
- POC kitchen scene is working and tested
- Player movement system is solid
- Scene transition system works
- F9 screenshot testing system is ready

### Key Files to Work With
- `src/scenes/poc/kitchen.tscn` - Add baby sprite here
- `src/scripts/poc/player_controller.gd` - Add pickup logic here
- Follow CLAUDE.md protocols for verification

## üéØ Definition of Done for Current Sprint
- [ ] Baby sprite visible in kitchen scene
- [ ] Spacebar pickup/putdown works smoothly
- [ ] Fuss meter decreases when baby alone
- [ ] Coffee interaction conflicts with baby holding
- [ ] Frustration meter increases when blocked
- [ ] F9 screenshots verify all functionality
- [ ] No console errors during gameplay

## üìù Session Notes
*Ready for next agent to begin MVP development*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Success Factors
- **BUILD ON POC SUCCESS** - Don't rebuild what's working
- **FOLLOW CLAUDE.MD** - Use temp directory, verify screenshots
- **USE F9 TESTING** - Built-in screenshot system is working
- **FOCUS ON CORE MECHANIC** - Baby pickup/putdown is the foundation
- **VERIFY VISUALLY** - Use Read tool on all screenshots

## üîú Next Session Priority - START HERE
**NEXT AGENT SHOULD BEGIN WITH:**
1. Add baby sprite to kitchen scene (static placement)
2. Test that scene still runs properly
3. Implement spacebar interaction detection near baby
4. Create pickup/putdown state management
5. Take F9 screenshots to verify each step
6. Use Read tool to verify all screenshots

## üèÜ SUCCESS CRITERIA - READY FOR NEXT AGENT
**MVP Foundation Goals:**
- Baby sprite added to scene ‚è≥
- Pickup/putdown mechanic working ‚è≥
- Fuss meter UI implemented ‚è≥
- Coffee interaction point added ‚è≥
- Core gameplay loop functional ‚è≥

**The POC is complete. Ready for MVP development of the innovative baby management mechanic.**
