*Last Updated: 2025-09-02 23:55*
*Session Started: 2025-09-02 23:45*
*Project Phase: Planning & Architecture - Pre-Implementation*

## üéØ NEXT AGENT HANDOFF

### Use: deep-research agent
**Mission**: Thoroughly analyze all planning documents to understand business objectives and game design goals for Scene 4 implementation.

**Key Questions to Answer**:
1. What emotional states need to be tracked and how do they interact?
2. What are the core gameplay loops and player decision points?
3. How do meters affect gameplay and narrative outcomes?
4. What are the success/failure conditions for each mechanic?
5. How do all systems integrate to create the intended player experience?

**Documents to Analyze**:
- `/planning/scenes/day-1/04_evening_and_dream.md` (PRIMARY)
- `/planning/core-gameplay-loop.md`
- `/planning/responsibility-cascade.md`
- `/planning/dream-sequences.md`
- `/planning/endgame-and-integration-mechanics.md`

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive analysis document that will inform technical specification creation.

## üöÄ Current Sprint Goal
**PLANNING PHASE**: Create comprehensive technical specification for Scene 4 implementation based on thorough understanding of business objectives and game design goals.

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Planning phase - deep research of planning documents
- **Next Agent**: deep-research agent to analyze all planning docs
- **Deliverable**: Technical specification document for Scene 4
- **Approach**: Understand business objectives first, then translate to technical requirements

### Key Decisions This Session
- Established planning-first approach before implementation
- Will create comprehensive technical spec before coding

### Key Planning Documents to Research
- `/planning/scenes/day-1/04_evening_and_dream.md` - Scene 4 detailed breakdown
- `/planning/core-gameplay-loop.md` - Core mechanics and player experience
- `/planning/responsibility-cascade.md` - Emotional mechanics framework
- `/planning/dream-sequences.md` - Dream state system design
- `/planning/endgame-and-integration-mechanics.md` - Overall game integration

### Expected Deliverables from Planning Phase
1. **Technical Specification Document** (`/planning/technical-spec-scene4.md`)
   - System architecture diagrams
   - Component interaction flows
   - Data structures and state management
   - Event system design
   - UI/UX requirements

2. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Dependency graph
   - Step-by-step build order
   - Testing checkpoints
   - Risk assessment

### Files to Create/Modify (After Planning)
- `globals/meter_system.gd` - Core emotional meter tracking
- `src/scripts/ui/meters/` - UI components for meter display
- `src/scripts/systems/baby_system.gd` - Baby interaction mechanics
- `src/scenes/day1/scene4/` - Scene 4 implementation files
- `src/scenes/gameplay/day1_scene4/` - Scene implementation
- `src/scripts/gameplay/baby_interaction.gd` - Baby holding mechanics

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# Continue with Godot editor:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir
godot project.godot

# Test any gameplay features with F9:
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir --maximized
# Then press F9 for automated testing when features are ready
```

## üéØ Definition of Done for Current Phase
- [ ] All three meters (Rage, Overwhelm, Reservoir) working with UI display
- [ ] Baby interaction system allows one-handed vs two-handed actions
- [ ] Fuss Meter timer system works correctly
- [ ] Unpacking sequence playable with proper challenge balance
- [ ] Bedtime minigame has two difficulty modes based on prior player choices
- [ ] Dream sequence reflects meter states with appropriate audio/visual changes
- [ ] All systems tested with screenshots and manual verification

## üìù Session Notes
- 23:45: Archived completed menu infrastructure work
- 23:45: Set up new session focused on actual game features
- Reference: Day 1 Scene 4 planning in `/planning/scenes/day-1/04_evening_and_dream.md`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Issues
*None currently - all infrastructure complete and ready for feature development*

## üîú Next Session Priority
After completing meter system architecture:
1. Focus on baby interaction mechanics as the core challenge
2. Build unpacking sequence as first major gameplay
3. Implement conditional bedtime experience

## üìö REFERENCE MATERIALS

### Scene 4 Overview (from planning doc):
1. **Part 1: The Ghosting** - Brother leaves, judgment vs empathy choice
2. **Part 2: One-Handed Burden** - Unpacking with clingy baby mechanics  
3. **Part 3: Salad of Solitude** - Narrative eating scene
4. **Part 4: Conditional Sanctuary** - Bedtime minigame (peaceful vs stressful)
5. **Part 5: Dream Framework** - Meter-influenced dream with morning reflection

### Key Mechanics to Implement:
- **Hold Baby Status**: Limits interactions to one-handed actions
- **Fuss Meter**: Timer for how long baby can be put down
- **Two-Handed Actions**: Require putting baby down temporarily
- **Conditional Outcomes**: Bedtime difficulty based on earlier "Rage Leak"
- **Dream Modifiers**: Visual/audio changes based on final meter values

### Meter System Requirements:
- **Rage Meter**: Tracks anger buildup, triggers "Rage Leak" events
- **Overwhelm Meter**: Cognitive load from environment/tasks
- **Reservoir Meter**: Accumulated emotional weight/suppression
- **UI Display**: Visual representation of all three meters
- **Save/Load**: Meter states persist between scenes
- **Events**: Meter changes trigger gameplay consequences

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE NOTES
- Use Godot's singleton pattern for meter system (autoload)
- Component-based baby interaction (can be attached to different objects)
- Scene-based approach for each part of Day 1 Scene 4
- Signal-driven communication between systems
- Resource files (.tres) for meter configurations and thresholds

## üß™ TESTING APPROACH
- F9 MenuVerifier system is working for menu testing
- Will need new testing tools for gameplay mechanics
- Screenshot verification for meter UI states
- Manual testing with specific meter value scenarios
- Automated testing for baby interaction timers

**INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE - READY TO BUILD REAL GAME!**
