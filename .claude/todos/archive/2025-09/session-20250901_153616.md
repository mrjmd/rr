*No active tasks - session complete*

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Session Status
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Dialogue panel bug resolved
- **Achievement**: Fixed critical invisibility bug with visual verification
- **Next Session**: Begin Week 5-6 menu systems implementation
- **Files Clean**: Debug files removed, project organized
  
## üìã PENDING (Next Session Priority)
1. [ ] Begin Week 5-6 menu systems implementation
   - Why: Core dialogue system now working, ready for next phase
   - Depends on: None - dialogue foundation complete
2. [ ] Implement debug overlay with sliders for testing
   - Why: Useful for ongoing development and testing
3. [ ] Test save/load system functionality
   - Why: Verify core systems before menu integration

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED THIS SESSION
- [x] **CRITICAL DIALOGUE PANEL BUG FIXED** (Completed: 17:30)
  - Result: Dialogue panel now fully visible and functional
  - Files: src/scripts/ui/dialogue/dialogue_system.gd (line 241 fix)

  - Solution: Replaced fade animation with direct visibility (Color.WHITE)
  - Visual Proof: Screenshot at testing/screenshots/current/dialogue_triggered.png
  - Verification: Dark blue panel with rounded corners clearly visible
- [x] Project cleanup and organization (Completed: 17:35)
  - Result: Debug files removed, screenshots organized
  - Files: Removed test files from project root, cleaned git status
- [x] Screenshot verification system validated (Completed: 15:25)
  - Result: Proven capture method works for visual verification
  - Files: testing/scripts/capture_game_screenshot.gd functional
- [x] Dialogue system architecture documented (Completed: 14:15)
  - Result: Clear understanding of system components and flow
  - Files: Updated system knowledge in session notes

### Key Decisions This Session
- 17:30: Fixed dialogue invisibility by removing problematic fade tween
- 15:25: Established screenshot verification as mandatory for visual bugs
- 14:15: Identified dialogue system architecture and component relationships
- 13:35: Decided to use Godot viewport captures over OS screenshots

### Files Modified
- `src/scripts/ui/dialogue/dialogue_system.gd` - Fixed panel visibility (line 241)
- `testing/scripts/capture_game_screenshot.gd` - Screenshot capture system
- `src/scenes/demo/dialogue_demo.tscn` - Testing scene for verification

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# If session interrupted, run these:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir

# Continue with Godot editor:
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir

# Test dialogue system (now working):
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir src/scenes/demo/dialogue_demo.tscn
```

## ‚ö° QUICK COMMANDS
```bash
# Test dialogue demo (now working)
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir src/scenes/demo/dialogue_demo.tscn

# Capture screenshot proof
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir --script testing/scripts/capture_game_screenshot.gd

# Test save/load system
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir src/scenes/testing/save_load_test.tscn
```

## üéØ Definition of Done for Current Task
- [x] GDScript has type hints
- [x] Dialogue system functional
- [x] Visual verification with screenshots
- [x] Component working properly
- [x] No console errors
