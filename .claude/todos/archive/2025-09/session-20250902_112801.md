# Rando's Reservoir - Current Session TODOs
*Last Updated: 2025-09-02 15:20*
*Session Started: 2025-09-02*
*Project Phase: POC BUILD PHASE*

## üöÄ Current Sprint Goal
**BUILD THE POC TODAY**: Kitchen scene with player movement (3 hours max)

## üéØ CONTEXT FOR NEXT AGENT
### What We've Completed
- [x] POC technical specification phase (DONE)
- [x] Feasibility assessment (DONE)  
- [x] Build-today.md guide created (READY TO USE)
- [x] Integration plan written (READY TO USE)
- [x] Scope decision made: POC ‚Üí MVP ‚Üí Full Game (DECIDED)

### What We're Building Now
**Simple kitchen scene where player walks around. Nothing else.**
- Kitchen floor + walls
- Player sprite that moves with WASD
- ESC to return to menu
- F6 to test standalone
- Screenshot proof it works

### Why We Scaled Back
The full game scope was 2+ years of work. The baby management mechanic is brilliant but needs to start simple. POC proves the concept works before expanding.

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Max 1 item)
- [ ] BUILD kitchen scene with player movement
  - Started: Ready to begin
  - Files: kitchen.tscn needs creation
  - Status: Specs complete, ready to implement
  - Next: Create src/scenes/poc/kitchen.tscn

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED THIS SESSION
- [x] Technical specification structure created
- [x] Feasibility assessment completed
- [x] MVP scope definition finalized
- [x] POC implementation plan written
- [x] Scaled back from complex full game to focused POC
- [x] Created step-by-step build guide at /planning/technical-specifications/poc/build-today.md

## üìã PENDING (Priority Order)
### TODAY'S POC BUILD TASKS (DO THESE FIRST)
1. [ ] Create src/scenes/poc/kitchen.tscn with floor and walls
   - Why: Core scene for testing player movement
   - Files: kitchen.tscn, player_controller.gd
   - Approach: Simple ColorRect for floor, walls as StaticBody2D
   
2. [ ] Add player sprite with WASD movement
   - Why: Core mechanic to validate
   - Depends on: Kitchen scene exists
   - Use: CharacterBody2D with velocity-based movement
   
3. [ ] Test scene runs standalone with F6
   - Why: Prove scene works before integration
   - Verification: F6 in Godot editor, WASD moves player
   
4. [ ] Connect kitchen scene to main menu
   - Why: Integration with existing game structure
   - Files: main_menu.gd needs scene transition
   
5. [ ] Add ESC key to return to menu
   - Why: User can exit POC cleanly
   - Files: player_controller.gd input handling
   
6. [ ] Take screenshot of working POC
   - Why: Proof of completion for stakeholder
   - Use: F9 in-game screenshot system

### TOMORROW (Only After POC Works)
1. [ ] Replace player icon.svg with actual character sprite
2. [ ] Add baby sprite in crib (static, no interaction yet)
3. [ ] Add kitchen furniture sprites for atmosphere
4. [ ] Polish movement feel and collision

### THIS WEEK (MVP Development)
1. [ ] Add baby pickup/putdown with spacebar
2. [ ] Add fuss meter UI element
3. [ ] Add coffee-making interaction points
4. [ ] Add frustration meter
5. [ ] Add basic win/lose conditions

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Building POC kitchen scene with player movement
- **File**: About to create src/scenes/poc/kitchen.tscn
- **Problem**: Need simple scene to validate player movement works
- **Solution**: Use build-today.md step-by-step guide

### Key Decisions This Session
- 15:00: Decided to build POC instead of continuing specifications
- 15:05: Confirmed baby management is the innovative core mechanic
- 15:10: Created build-today.md with exact implementation steps
- 15:15: Scaled scope to focus on proving concept works first

### Essential Reference Files
- `/planning/technical-specifications/poc/build-today.md` - STEP-BY-STEP BUILD GUIDE
- `/planning/technical-specifications/poc/proof-of-concept.md` - Full POC specification  
- `/planning/technical-specifications/poc/integration-plan.md` - Menu integration details
- `/planning/technical-specifications/feasibility-assessment.md` - Why we scaled back
- `/planning/technical-specifications/mvp/scope.md` - What comes after POC success

### Commands to Resume Building
```bash
# Continue with implementation:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot project.godot

# Create POC directory structure:
mkdir -p src/scenes/poc
mkdir -p src/scripts/poc

# Follow build-today.md step-by-step:
# 1. Create kitchen.tscn
# 2. Add player controller
# 3. Test with F6
# 4. Integrate with menu
# 5. Test with F9 screenshots
```

## üéØ Definition of Done for Current Task
- [ ] kitchen.tscn scene created and opens in editor
- [ ] Player CharacterBody2D with movement script
- [ ] WASD keys move player around kitchen
- [ ] F6 runs scene standalone without errors
- [ ] ESC key returns to main menu
- [ ] F9 screenshot shows player in kitchen scene
- [ ] Screenshot verified with Read tool (not black/empty)
- [ ] No console errors during testing

## üìù Session Notes
- 15:00: Transitioned from specification to implementation phase
- 15:05: Key insight: Baby management mechanic could be as innovative as "Papers, Please" document checking
- 15:10: Created comprehensive build guide to ensure next agent can immediately start implementing
- 15:15: Confirmed POC approach: prove concept works before expanding scope

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Success Factors
- **START BUILDING NOW** - Specifications are complete, implementation is needed
- **USE THE BUILD GUIDE** - /planning/technical-specifications/poc/build-today.md has exact steps
- **KEEP IT SIMPLE** - Just player movement in kitchen, nothing more
- **VERIFY WITH SCREENSHOTS** - F9 system exists and works
- **FOLLOW CLAUDE.md PROTOCOLS** - Use agents and proper verification

## üîú Next Session Priority
**IMMEDIATE**: Create kitchen.tscn scene
1. Open Godot editor
2. Create src/scenes/poc/kitchen.tscn
3. Add floor (ColorRect) and walls (StaticBody2D)
4. Add player (CharacterBody2D) with movement script
5. Test with F6 that player moves with WASD
6. Take F9 screenshot as proof
7. Integrate with main menu
8. Final verification and handoff

## üèÜ SUCCESS CRITERIA
By end of next session:
- Kitchen scene exists and runs
- Player walks around with WASD
- ESC returns to menu  
- Screenshot proves it works
- Foundation ready for MVP features

**The baby management innovation starts here - but first we need a working foundation.**
