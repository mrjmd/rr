# Rando's Reservoir - Current Session TODOs
*Last Updated: 2025-09-02 17:40*
*Session Started: 2025-09-02 14:30*
*Project Phase: Menu Systems - Final Fix Required*

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY FOR NEXT AGENT

### ✅ WHAT'S WORKING
1. **Pause Menu** - ESC and P keys work perfectly (verified with screenshots)
2. **Main Menu** - Loads visible when run standalone
3. **Testing Infrastructure** - F9 key triggers MenuVerifier for automated testing
4. **Screenshot Verification** - cliclick tool documented and working for key simulation

### ❌ WHAT'S BROKEN
1. **Settings Menu from Pause** - Button clicks but settings never appears
   - MenuManager loads settings_menu.tscn
   - BaseMenu initializes but menu stays invisible
   - FadeTransition runs but doesn't reveal the menu
   - Screenshot proof: `05_settings_attempt.png` shows pause menu still visible

### 🔍 LAST INVESTIGATION POINT
- Changed MenuManager path from `settings_menu_standalone.tscn` to `settings_menu.tscn`
- Settings menu initializes (per console output) but never becomes visible
- Issue appears to be in `_switch_to_menu` function or visibility handling

## 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Max 1 item)
- [ ] Fix settings menu visibility when opened from pause menu
  - Why: Settings button in pause menu doesn't show settings
  - Last attempt: Changed scene path in MenuManager
  - Next step: Debug why menu initializes but doesn't show

## 📋 PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Test settings menu fix with proper verification
   - Run game, press F9, check screenshot 05
   - Must show settings menu, not pause menu
2. [ ] Complete menu system and move to game features
   - Only after ALL menus verified working

## 🛠️ HOW TO TEST PROPERLY

### Run Test with Verification:
```bash
# Clear old screenshots
rm -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/Godot/app_userdata/Rando\'s\ Reservoir/testing/screenshots/current/*.png

# Run game
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir 2>&1 | tee /tmp/godot_output.log &

# Wait for load, then press F9
sleep 4
cliclick kp:f9

# Check results
grep -E "(TEST|✓|✗|settings)" /tmp/godot_output.log
```

### Read Screenshots:
```bash
# Check what was created
ls -lat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Godot/app_userdata/Rando\'s\ Reservoir/testing/screenshots/current/*.png

# Use Read tool on each file, especially:
# - 02_pause_menu_esc.png (should show pause menu)
# - 05_settings_attempt.png (should show settings, currently shows pause)
```

## 📍 KEY FILES TO CHECK
- `/globals/menu_manager.gd` - Controls menu switching
- `/src/scripts/ui/menus/settings_menu.gd` - Extends BaseMenu
- `/src/scripts/ui/menus/base_menu.gd` - Base class handling visibility
- `/src/scripts/testing/menu_verifier.gd` - F9 test script (working)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS
1. **USE CLICLICK** - It's installed and works for key simulation
2. **NO STANDALONE SCRIPTS** - Use F9 in-game testing
3. **READ SCREENSHOTS** - Don't trust console output alone
4. **CHECK TIMESTAMPS** - Use `ls -lat` to verify new files

## 🎯 DEFINITION OF DONE
- [ ] Settings menu opens from pause menu (screenshot proof)
- [ ] All 3 tests pass in MenuVerifier (ESC, P, Settings)
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Screenshots show correct UI states

## 📝 Session Notes
- 17:00: Discovered cliclick works for automation
- 17:20: Fixed MenuManager scene path
- 17:35: Settings still not showing despite initialization
- **HANDOFF**: Settings menu visibility issue needs debugging

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS FOR NEW AGENT

### THE EXACT PROBLEM
Settings menu initializes (console shows "BaseMenu initialized: settings_menu") but never becomes visible when clicked from pause menu. The screenshot `05_settings_attempt.png` shows pause menu still visible instead of settings.

### WHERE TO LOOK
1. **BaseMenu visibility logic** - `/src/scripts/ui/menus/base_menu.gd`
   - Check why menu doesn't become visible despite initialization
2. **MenuManager's _switch_to_menu** - `/globals/menu_manager.gd` line ~160
   - This function should hide pause and show settings
3. **FadeTransition issue** - Why doesn't it reveal the settings menu?

### EXACT TEST COMMANDS
```bash
# Clear old screenshots first
rm -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/Godot/app_userdata/Rando\'s\ Reservoir/testing/screenshots/current/*.png

# Run the game
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir 2>&1 | tee /tmp/godot_output.log &

# Wait for it to load
sleep 4

# Press F9 to run automated test
cliclick kp:f9

# Wait for test to complete
sleep 10

# Check the console output
grep -E "(TEST|✓|✗|Settings|settings)" /tmp/godot_output.log

# READ THE CRITICAL SCREENSHOT
# This should show settings menu but currently shows pause menu:
Read ~/Library/Application\ Support/Godot/app_userdata/Rando\'s\ Reservoir/testing/screenshots/current/05_settings_attempt.png
```

### WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE
- Screenshot 05 shows SETTINGS menu with tabs (Audio/Video/Controls)
- Console shows "✓ Settings menu opened"
- All 3 tests pass (ESC ✓, P ✓, Settings ✓)

### CRITICAL TOOLS YOU HAVE
- **cliclick** - Installed! Use it to press keys: `cliclick kp:f9`
- **F9 key** - Triggers MenuVerifier test automatically
- **Read tool** - MUST use to verify screenshots

Once this ONE issue is fixed, we can FINALLY move past menu hell to actual game features!
