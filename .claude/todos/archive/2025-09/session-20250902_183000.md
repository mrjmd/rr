*Project Phase: POC BUILD ‚Üí MVP READY*

## üèÜ SESSION ACCOMPLISHMENTS

### üéØ POC IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE SUCCESS
**Built and verified working POC kitchen scene:**
- Kitchen scene with player movement controller
- WASD controls for player movement  
- ESC pause menu integration
- Main menu "Start Game" button integration
- Scene transitions working (kitchen ‚Üî main menu)
- Screenshot verification completed

### üìã Specifications and Planning
- Technical specification structure created
- Feasibility assessment completed (confirmed 2D approach)
- MVP scope definition finalized
- POC implementation plan written
- Step-by-step build guide created

### üßπ Project Organization
- Created `/temp/` directory for temporary files
- Updated `.gitignore` to include temp directory
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with temp directory protocol
- Prepared comprehensive handoff documentation

## üöÄ KEY TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS

### Scene Structure Implemented
```
Kitchen (Node2D)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Floor (ColorRect 800x600, color #3B2F2F)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Player (CharacterBody2D with movement script)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sprite2D (icon.svg, scaled 0.25)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CollisionShape2D (32x32 rectangle)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Walls (4x StaticBody2D: Top, Bottom, Left, Right)
```

### Files Created
- `/src/scenes/poc/kitchen.tscn` - POC kitchen scene
- `/src/scripts/poc/player_controller.gd` - Player movement controller
- `/temp/.keep` - Temporary files directory structure
- Multiple specification documents in `/planning/technical-specifications/`

### Integration Verified
- Main menu Start Game button connects to kitchen scene
- ESC key in kitchen returns to main menu
- No console errors during scene transitions
- Screenshot verification protocol followed

## üéØ HANDOFF CONTEXT FOR NEXT AGENT

### üèÅ POC STATUS: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED
The proof of concept is fully working and ready for MVP development. Core movement and scene structure proven successful.

### üöÄ IMMEDIATE MVP PRIORITIES
**Next agent should implement core baby management mechanic:**

1. **Add Baby Sprite** (Day 1)
   - Add baby sprite to kitchen scene
   - Position in crib/safe area initially
   - Test scene still works with new sprite

2. **Implement Pickup/Putdown** (Day 1-2)  
   - Spacebar interaction when near baby
   - Baby follows player when carried
   - Baby returns to crib when put down
   - State management for carrying/not carrying

3. **Add Fuss Meter** (Day 2-3)
   - UI progress bar for baby contentment
   - Decreases over time when baby alone
   - Visual feedback system

4. **Add Coffee Interaction** (Day 3-4)
   - Coffee machine interaction point
   - Can't make coffee while holding baby
   - Creates core gameplay conflict

5. **Add Frustration Meter** (Day 4-5)
   - Player stress meter UI
   - Increases when tasks blocked by baby
   - Balances against baby happiness

## üìÅ CRITICAL REFERENCE FILES

### For Next Agent
- `.claude/todos/current.md` - Updated with MVP priorities
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with temp directory protocol
- `/planning/technical-specifications/poc/build-today.md` - Implementation guide
- `/planning/technical-specifications/mvp/scope.md` - MVP scope definition

### POC Implementation Files
- `/src/scenes/poc/kitchen.tscn` - Working kitchen scene
- `/src/scripts/poc/player_controller.gd` - Player controller

### Architecture References  
- `/planning/technical-specifications/poc/proof-of-concept.md` - Full POC spec
- `/planning/technical-specifications/feasibility-assessment.md` - Technical decisions
- `/planning/technical-specifications/poc/integration-plan.md` - Menu integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR NEXT AGENT

### MUST DO:
1. **Read `.claude/todos/current.md` first** - Complete handoff context
2. **Follow CLAUDE.md protocols** - Temp files in `/temp/`, screenshots verified
3. **Use F9 screenshot system** - Built-in testing infrastructure exists
4. **Verify with Read tool** - NEVER claim success without reading screenshots
5. **Start with baby sprite** - Core mechanic foundation

### DON'T DO:
- Don't rebuild POC - it's complete and working
- Don't create standalone test scripts - use F9 system
- Don't put temp files in project root - use `/temp/`
- Don't skip screenshot verification - required by CLAUDE.md

## üß™ VERIFICATION COMMANDS READY
```bash
# Launch POC kitchen scene (verified working):
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir res://src/scenes/poc/kitchen.tscn --maximized

# Launch full game (main menu ‚Üí kitchen transition verified):
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir --maximized

# Screenshot testing protocol established and working
```

## üéâ SESSION OUTCOME

**SUCCESS**: POC complete, verified working, handoff documentation prepared

**NEXT PHASE**: MVP development - baby management mechanic implementation

**INNOVATION CONFIRMED**: Baby management concept is solid foundation for unique gameplay
