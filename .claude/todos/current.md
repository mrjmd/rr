# Rando's Reservoir - Current Session TODOs
*Last Updated: 2025-09-01 17:20*
*Session Started: Session 4 - Week 3-4 Dialogue System Development*
*Project Phase: Dialogue Components & Scene Systems*

## üöÄ Current Sprint Goal
Build dialogue UI components and continue Week 3-4 scene systems development. Build on the successful fade transition system from Session 3.

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Max 1 item)
*Ready to begin next task*

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED THIS SESSION
*New session started*

## üìã PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Clean up screenshot directories (consolidate test_screenshots and test_screenshots_automated)
   - Why: Organize testing artifacts from fade transition work
   - Depends on: None - maintenance task
   - Estimate: 15 minutes

2. [ ] Create dialogue UI components (Week 3-4 requirement)
   - Why: Core gameplay mechanic for all scenes
   - Depends on: Fade transitions (COMPLETE ‚úÖ)
   - Components needed: DialogueBox, CharacterPortrait, ChoiceButtons, TextAnimator
   - Estimate: 2-3 hours

3. [ ] Test save/load system functionality
   - Why: Week 1-2 completion requirement validation
   - Depends on: None - foundation system testing
   - Estimate: 1 hour

4. [ ] Implement debug overlay panel with interactive sliders
   - Why: Enhanced testing capabilities for dialogue and emotional states
   - Depends on: Working dialogue system preferred
   - Estimate: 1.5 hours

5. [ ] Begin Week 5-6 menu systems
   - Why: Next major development phase
   - Depends on: Week 3-4 completion
   - Estimate: Planning phase

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Session 3 Success Summary
- **Major Achievement**: Fade transition system fully working
- **Technical Breakthrough**: Fixed tween completion using get_tree().create_tween()
- **UI Fix**: Canvas layer ordering (UI: 200, Fade: 100) prevents blocking
- **Interactive Testing**: Keyboard shortcuts (SPACE, F, G, T) for all fade types
- **Visual Proof**: Screenshot evidence of cyan‚Üíblack‚Üícyan transitions

### Currently Working On
- **Task**: None - ready to begin next priority
- **File**: None
- **Status**: Session 4 starting fresh with solid foundation

### Key Decisions From Session 3
- 17:05: Use get_tree().create_tween() for proper signal emission
- 17:08: Canvas layer ordering critical (UI: 200, Fade: 100)
- 17:12: Visual confirmation required - debug output insufficient
- 17:15: Screenshot testing methodology proven effective

### Files Recently Modified (Session 3)
- `src/scripts/transitions/fade_transition.gd` - Fixed tween implementation
- Scene layer configurations - Updated canvas layer ordering
- Demo scenes - Added keyboard shortcuts for testing

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# Continue with Godot editor:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --editor --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir

# Quick system verification:
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir

# Test working fade transitions:
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir src/scenes/demo/fade_demo.tscn
```

## üéØ Definition of Done for Next Task (Directory Cleanup)
- [ ] Consolidate test_screenshots and test_screenshots_automated folders
- [ ] Organize screenshots by session/date
- [ ] Remove duplicate or unnecessary test images
- [ ] Update any script references to new paths
- [ ] Document final directory structure

## üìù Session Notes
- 17:20: **Session 4 Started** - Building on Session 3 success with fade transitions
- Ready to proceed with dialogue system development
- All foundation systems verified working
- Clear technical patterns established from Session 3 learnings

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Carried Forward)
- UI meter positioning/overlap (non-blocking, documented for later)
- Screenshot directory organization (Priority #1 to address)

## üîú Next Session Priority
Focus on dialogue system development as core Week 3-4 requirement:
1. Clean up project organization first
2. Design dialogue UI component architecture  
3. Implement basic dialogue box with text animation
4. Add character portrait system
5. Create choice button components

## üìä Current Development Status

### Week 3-4: Scene Systems (40% Complete - On Track)
**PROGRESS UPDATE:**
- [x] Scene transition animations (**CONFIRMED WORKING**) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Dialogue system foundation (Next priority)
- [ ] Save system testing (Ready to proceed)

### Foundation Systems Status (98% Complete)
- Core architecture ‚úÖ
- State machines ‚úÖ
- Event bus ‚úÖ
- Player controller ‚úÖ
- Emotional states ‚úÖ
- UI meters (functional) ‚úÖ
- **Scene transitions** ‚úÖ (**WORKING - Session 3 Success**)

### Technical Momentum
- Proven debugging methodology
- Visual confirmation testing established
- Godot best practices identified
- Canvas layer architecture defined
- Ready for dialogue system development

---

**Session 4 Status**: Ready to begin dialogue system development with solid foundation and proven technical patterns from Session 3 success.
