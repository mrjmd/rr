## üìÖ Week-by-Week Implementation Plan

## üìã PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Create game HUD scene with meter display integration
   - Why: Need visual implementation of completed scripts
   - Depends on: UI meter scenes being created first
   
2. [ ] Implement debug overlay panel with interactive sliders
   - Why: Essential for efficient testing and development
   - Depends on: UI scenes being functional
   
3. [ ] Create fade transition effects between scenes
   - Why: Required for Week 3-4 scene systems
   - Depends on: Scene manager integration
   
4. [ ] Create base dialogue UI components (dialogue box, choice buttons)
   - Why: Core gameplay mechanic for all scenes
   - Depends on: Basic UI systems established
   
5. [ ] Test save/load system functionality
   - Why: Week 1-2 completion requirement
   - Depends on: Game states being testable

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Create visual UI meter scenes in Godot editor from script templates
- **File**: Will create src/scenes/ui/meters/rage_meter.tscn and reservoir_meter.tscn
- **Line**: New files from templates
- **Problem**: Need to create visual .tscn scenes using completed scripts
- **Solution**: Use Godot editor to create ProgressBar-based scenes with proper theming

### Key Decisions This Session
- Complete architectural change from side-scroller to top-down confirmed
- Component-based UI approach with separate scripts for modularity
- Signal-driven architecture using EventBus for loose coupling
- Resource-based EmotionalState for easy editing and persistence
- Built-in debug tools for efficient development workflow

### Files Modified
- `src/scripts/entities/player/player_controller.gd` - Complete rewrite for top-down
- `src/scripts/entities/player/states/player_*_state.gd` - Updated all states
- `src/scripts/ui/meters/rage_meter.gd` - Complete UI meter implementation
- `src/scripts/ui/meters/reservoir_meter.gd` - Complete UI meter implementation
- `src/scripts/ui/hud/game_hud.gd` - HUD integration script
- `src/scripts/ui/debug/debug_overlay.gd` - Debug controls
- `project.godot` - Added run input action
- `globals/event_bus.gd` - Updated player events

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# If session interrupted, run these:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir

# Continue with Godot editor:
godot project.godot

# Test current implementation:
# 1. Create test scene with player controller
# 2. Use WASD/arrows for movement, Shift to run
# 3. Press 1,2,3 to test emotional states
# 4. Press F1,F2 for debug controls
```

## üéØ Definition of Done for Current Task
- [ ] RageMeter.tscn created with ProgressBar node
