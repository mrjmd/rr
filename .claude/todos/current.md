*Last Updated: 2025-09-01 18:15*
*Session Started: 2025-09-01 18:15*
*Project Phase: Prototype*

## üöÄ Current Sprint Goal
**Week 5-6 Menu Systems Implementation**: Building complete menu system with main menu, pause menu, and settings menu including navigation, transitions, and user feedback.

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Max 1 item)
*No tasks currently in progress*

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Begin Week 5-6 menu systems implementation
- **Phase**: Research existing UI patterns
- **Next Step**: Analyze src/scenes/ui/ directory structure
- **Goal**: Understand current UI architecture before building menus
- **Files to Review**: UI scenes, scripts, and existing menu components
  
## üìã PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] **NEXT PRIORITY**: Resolve BaseMenu class loading issues
   - Why: Current menu system has BaseMenu dependency problems
   - Issue: Scripts can't find BaseMenu class during loading
   - Solution: Need to fix autoload order or create proper class registration
   - Files: src/scripts/ui/menus/base_menu.gd and all extending menus
2. [ ] Integrate standalone settings menu with main/pause menus
   - Why: Settings menu needs to be accessible from other menus
   - Depends on: BaseMenu issues resolved OR adapt standalone approach
3. [ ] Create main menu scene and script
   - Why: Core entry point for the game
   - Status: Partially exists but has BaseMenu dependency issues
5. [ ] Implement menu navigation and transitions
   - Why: Seamless user experience between menus
   - Depends on: All menu scenes created
6. [ ] Add visual/audio feedback for menu interactions
   - Why: Polish and user experience enhancement
   - Depends on: Navigation system working
7. [ ] Test all menu flows with screenshots
   - Why: Visual verification of complete menu system
   - Depends on: All menu features implemented
8. [ ] Implement debug overlay with sliders for testing
   - Why: Useful for ongoing development and testing
   - Depends on: Menu system complete
9. [ ] Test save/load system functionality
   - Why: Verify core systems integration with menus
   - Depends on: Menu system functional

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED THIS SESSION
- [x] **COMPREHENSIVE SETTINGS MENU SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED** (Completed: 20:45)
  - Result: Fully functional settings menu with audio/video/controls tabs
  - Files: 
    * src/scripts/ui/menus/settings_menu_standalone.gd (main implementation)
    * src/scenes/ui/menus/settings_menu_standalone.tscn (UI scene)
    * src/scripts/demo/settings_menu_standalone_demo.gd (demo script)
    * src/scenes/demo/settings_menu_standalone_demo.tscn (demo scene)
  - Features: Audio volume sliders (Master/Music/SFX), Video settings (Fullscreen/VSync), Controls info tab
  - Integration: Works with AudioManager and GameManager when available
  - Visual Proof: Demo runs successfully with all functionality working
  - Note: Created standalone version due to BaseMenu loading issues (to be resolved later)

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED PREVIOUS SESSION
- [x] **CRITICAL DIALOGUE PANEL BUG FIXED** (Completed: 17:30)
  - Result: Dialogue panel now fully visible and functional
  - Files: src/scripts/ui/dialogue/dialogue_system.gd (line 241 fix)
  - Root Cause: Fade tween animation not completing, leaving alpha at 0
  - Solution: Replaced fade animation with direct visibility (Color.WHITE)
  - Visual Proof: Screenshot at testing/screenshots/current/dialogue_triggered.png
  - Verification: Dark blue panel with rounded corners clearly visible
- [x] Project cleanup and organization (Completed: 17:35)
  - Result: Debug files removed, screenshots organized
  - Files: Removed test files from project root, cleaned git status
- [x] Screenshot verification system validated (Completed: 15:25)
  - Result: Proven capture method works for visual verification
  - Files: testing/scripts/capture_game_screenshot.gd functional
- [x] Dialogue system architecture documented (Completed: 14:15)
  - Result: Clear understanding of system components and flow
  - Files: Updated system knowledge in session notes
