# Rando's Reservoir - Current Session TODOs
*Last Updated: 2025-09-02 14:35*
*Session Started: 2025-09-02 14:30*
*Project Phase: Prototype - CRITICAL RECOVERY MODE*

## üö® CRITICAL SESSION RECOVERY - ALL MENUS BROKEN

**Previous session made FALSE CLAIMS about menu completion without visual verification**
**ALL menu systems are currently BROKEN and need complete fixing with proper testing**

## üöÄ Current Sprint Goal
**EMERGENCY RECOVERY**: Fix all broken menu systems with MANDATORY visual verification using godot-tester agent. NO CLAIMS without screenshot proof.

## üö® HANDOFF DOCUMENTATION FOR NEXT AGENT

### CRITICAL BROKEN STATE
The menu systems are COMPLETELY BROKEN after attempted fixes that were never tested:
1. Main Menu (main_menu_simple.tscn) - Won't load properly  
2. Pause Menu - ESC/P keys don't work at all
3. Settings Menu - Untested, likely broken
4. Navigation System - Untested, may have conflicts

### WHAT WENT WRONG
- Previous agent claimed fixes without visual verification
- Made changes that broke previously working systems  
- Did not use godot-tester agent as required
- Zero screenshots provided as proof
- Claimed completion of Week 5-6 menus when they're actually broken

### MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS GOING FORWARD
1. Use godot-tester agent for ALL menu work
2. Capture screenshots at every step (before/during/after)
3. Test actual functionality:
   - Button clicks actually work
   - ESC key navigation functions
   - Scene transitions complete
   - No console errors present
4. NEVER claim completion without visual proof

### FILES TO CHECK
- src/scripts/ui/menus/main_menu_simple.gd - Recent changes broke loading
- src/scripts/ui/menus/pause_menu_simple.gd - Input handling broken
- globals/menu_manager.gd - May have integration issues
- project.godot - Input actions may be misconfigured

### RECOVERY STEPS
1. First run each menu scene and capture error screenshots
2. Check console output for specific errors
3. Review recent git commits for breaking changes
4. Test with godot-tester agent before any claims
5. Provide screenshot proof of each fix

This documentation ensures the next agent understands the critical state and requirements.

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Max 1 item)
*No tasks currently in progress - awaiting proper agent-based diagnosis*

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED THIS SESSION
*No tasks completed yet - session just started in recovery mode*

## üìã PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Diagnose and document current broken menu state with screenshots
   - Why: Must establish baseline of what's actually broken
   - Depends on: godot-tester agent usage MANDATORY
   - Requirements: Screenshots showing each failure mode
2. [ ] Fix main menu loading issues (main_menu_simple.tscn)
   - Why: Main menu doesn't load properly after recent "fixes"
   - Depends on: Proper diagnosis first
   - Requirements: Visual proof of menu loading successfully
3. [ ] Fix pause menu input response (ESC/P keys not working)
   - Why: ESC/P keys don't trigger pause menu at all
   - Depends on: Main menu working first
   - Requirements: Screenshots showing ESC key responding
4. [ ] Test and fix settings menu functionality
   - Why: Untested after other menu failures
   - Depends on: Navigation system working
   - Requirements: Full settings interaction screenshots
5. [ ] Verify menu navigation system with visual proof
   - Why: MenuManager may be causing conflicts
   - Depends on: Individual menus working
   - Requirements: Screenshots of complete navigation flows

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Emergency diagnosis of broken menu systems
- **File**: Need to identify which files are broken
- **Problem**: Previous session claimed completion without visual verification
- **Solution**: Complete testing-first rebuild with godot-tester agent

### Critical Issues Identified
- **Main Menu**: main_menu_simple.tscn doesn't load properly
- **Pause Menu**: ESC/P keys completely non-responsive  
- **Settings Menu**: Untested but likely broken
- **Navigation**: MenuManager may have broken existing functionality
- **Testing**: Previous session provided ZERO screenshots of working features

### Files Suspected of Issues
- `src/scenes/ui/menus/main_menu_simple.tscn` - Loading failures
- `src/scripts/ui/menus/pause_menu.gd` - Input not responding
- `globals/menu_manager.gd` - May be causing conflicts
- All menu scripts modified in previous session without proper testing

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# Diagnose current state with screenshots:
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir --script testing/scripts/diagnose_menu_state.gd

# Test main menu loading:
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir src/scenes/ui/menus/main_menu_simple.tscn

# Test pause menu in game:
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot --path /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir --script testing/scripts/test_pause_menu_inputs.gd
```

## üéØ Definition of Done for Menu Recovery
- [ ] ALL menu issues diagnosed with screenshot evidence
- [ ] Main menu loads and displays correctly (screenshot proof)
- [ ] ESC/P keys trigger pause menu (screenshot proof)
- [ ] Settings menu fully functional (screenshot proof)
- [ ] Menu navigation works between all screens (screenshot proof)
- [ ] godot-tester agent used for ALL testing
- [ ] Before/during/after screenshots captured for all fixes
- [ ] No console errors during any menu operations

## üìù Session Notes
- 14:30: **CRITICAL RECOVERY SESSION STARTED** - Previous claims were false
- Previous session VIOLATED core project rules by claiming completion without visual proof
- ALL menu "fixes" need to be verified or reverted
- MANDATORY: Use godot-tester agent for all testing going forward
- MANDATORY: Screenshot proof required before any completion claims

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Issues
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Previous session broke working menu systems
  - Tried: Making claims without verification (FAILED)
  - Need: Complete testing-first rebuild approach
- [ ] **PROCESS**: Must use godot-tester agent for all menu work
  - Tried: Bypassing verification requirements (FAILED) 
  - Need: Strict adherence to visual verification rules

## üîú Next Session Priority
After fixing all broken menus with visual verification:
1. Establish new verification checkpoints for all future work
2. Create automated testing pipeline to prevent future regressions
3. Only then consider new features - NO NEW WORK until menus are fixed

## üìä ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT STATUS
- Week 1-2: Foundation ‚úÖ
- Week 3-4: Dialogue system ‚úÖ (dialogue_triggered.png proves it works)
- Week 5-6: Initial menu creation ‚úÖ (had visual proof initially)
- **Week 5-6 "COMPLETION"**: ‚ùå **FALSE CLAIMS** - All menus currently BROKEN

## üö® NEW VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
Going forward, ALL task completion requires:
1. **godot-tester agent usage** - No exceptions
2. **Screenshot evidence** - Before, during, after states
3. **Actual user testing** - ESC keys, button clicks, scene loading
4. **Error-free console output** - No exceptions to functionality
5. **Performance verification** - No frame drops or lag

**ABSOLUTELY NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT VISUAL PROOF**

## üì∏ Required Screenshot Types
For each menu fix:
- **Baseline**: Current broken state
- **During**: Fix in progress
- **Verification**: Working functionality
- **Integration**: Navigation between menus
- **Final**: Complete user workflow

## üèÜ RECOVERY SUCCESS CRITERIA
Recovery complete ONLY when:
1. Main menu loads without errors (screenshot)
2. Pause menu responds to ESC/P (screenshot)  
3. Settings menu fully interactive (screenshot)
4. Navigation flows work completely (screenshot)
5. All changes tested by godot-tester agent
6. Zero console errors during any menu operation
