## üîÑ CURRENT WORK: Convert Player Controller to Top-Down RPG

### üéØ ACTIVE TASK
**Convert Side-Scroller to Top-Down Movement**
**Priority**: HIGH - Game architecture change
**Assigned**: godot-specialist agent

**Requirements**:
- [x] Remove ALL gravity, jumping, coyote time, jump buffering from player_controller.gd  
- [x] Implement 8-directional top-down movement (up, down, left, right, diagonals)
- [x] Movement speeds: 200 pixels/sec (walking), 350 pixels/sec (running with shift)
- [x] Use existing move_up, move_down, move_left, move_right input actions
- [x] Smooth movement with acceleration/deceleration
- [x] Sprite faces movement direction (8-way facing)
- [x] Remove jump and fall states entirely
- [x] Keep idle and walk states, add run state
- [x] Maintain integration with emotional state system affecting movement speed

**Files Updated**:
- [x] `/Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir/src/scripts/entities/player/player_controller.gd` - Completely rewritten for top-down
- [x] `/Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir/src/scripts/entities/player/states/player_idle_state.gd` - Updated for top-down  
- [x] `/Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir/src/scripts/entities/player/states/player_walk_state.gd` - Updated for top-down
- [x] DELETED: `/Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir/src/scripts/entities/player/states/player_jump_state.gd`
- [x] DELETED: `/Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir/src/scripts/entities/player/states/player_fall_state.gd`
- [x] CREATED: `/Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir/src/scripts/entities/player/states/player_run_state.gd`
- [x] Updated: `/Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir/project.godot` - Added run input action (Shift key)
- [x] Updated: `/Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir/globals/event_bus.gd` - Updated player events

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Delivered**: Complete player system with:
- [x] Created player controller script with state machine integration
- [x] Implemented all player states (Idle, Walking, Jumping, Falling)  
- [x] Integrated with existing EmotionalState resource
- [x] Added input actions (jump, debug controls) to project.godot
- [x] Updated EventBus with player-related signals
- [x] Created scene templates and setup documentation
- [x] Configured proper Godot 4.4 architecture patterns

**Next Step**: Convert to top-down movement, then create actual .tscn scene files in Godot editor

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Emotional State UI Components
**Status**: COMPLETED - Scripts and templates ready
**Task**: Create rage meter and reservoir meter UI components
**Components completed**:
- [x] RageMeter script (src/scripts/ui/meters/rage_meter.gd) with full functionality
- [x] ReservoirMeter script (src/scripts/ui/meters/reservoir_meter.gd) with full functionality
- [x] GameHUD script (src/scripts/ui/hud/game_hud.gd) with integration and debug controls
- [x] Integration with GameManager.emotional_state through signals
- [x] EventBus integration for real-time updates
- [x] Proper UI theming with StyleBoxFlat resources
- [x] Smooth animations using Tween
- [x] Responsive positioning and anchoring
- [x] Scene templates for Godot editor creation
- [x] Test scene script for component validation
- [x] Debug controls (F1/F2 keys, sliders, reset buttons)
- [x] Added debug input actions to project.godot

**Next step**: Create .tscn files in Godot editor using the provided templates

**Requirements**:
- Use ProgressBar nodes for visual representation
- Color changes based on thresholds (green ‚Üí yellow ‚Üí orange ‚Üí red)
- Threshold markers at 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%
- Pulsing/shaking effect when rage >75%
- Reservoir meter only appears after first suppression
- HUD positioned at top-left corner with proper anchoring
- Follow existing UI patterns and Godot 4.4 conventions

### This Week Priority
- [x] ~~**Convert player controller to top-down RPG movement**~~ **‚úÖ COMPLETED**
- [x] ~~Create base player scene and controller~~ **COMPLETED**
- [x] ~~Implement emotional state UI (rage meter, reservoir meter)~~ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Set up debug overlay for testing
- [ ] Create fade transition scenes
- [ ] Test state machine with player states (calm, stressed, overwhelmed)
- [ ] Create base dialogue UI components

### Tomorrow's Focus
1. ‚úÖ ~~**Complete top-down movement conversion (HIGH PRIORITY)**~~ **COMPLETED**
2. Test new movement system with emotional state integration
3. Verify state machine transitions work with new states
4. Create player scene files in Godot editor with new controller

## üêõ Known Issues / Blockers
- Player controller currently designed for side-scroller but game is top-down RPG **IN PROGRESS**

---

## üìù Notes
- All core systems are in place and ready for scene development
- Focus should shift from architecture to content creation
- Debug tools needed for efficient testing
- Consider creating test scenes for each major system
- Current work: Converting player movement from side-scroller to top-down RPG style
- Input actions already properly configured for 8-directional movement (WASD + arrows)
