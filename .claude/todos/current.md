*Last Updated: 2025-09-01 10:31*
*Session Started: Session 3 - Ready for Week 3-4 Scene Systems*
*Project Phase: Week 1-2 Foundation Systems ‚Üí Week 3-4 Scene Systems*

## üöÄ Current Sprint Goal
Complete final Week 1-2 Foundation Systems items and transition to Week 3-4 Scene Systems. Focus on scene transitions, dialogue UI, and system testing.

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS (Max 1 item)
- [ ] Archive Session 2 progress and create fresh session for Week 3-4 Scene Systems
  - Started: 10:31
  - Files: .claude/todos/current.md, archive/
  - Status: Documenting Session 2 completion and issues
  - Next: Archive session and set up next priorities

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED SESSION 2 (Major Progress)
- [x] Fixed player controller naming conflict (is_running function) (Completed: Session 2)
  - Result: Resolved function naming conflicts in player state system
  - Files: player_controller.gd and related state files
  - Tests: Player movement working correctly

- [x] Created EmotionalState resource class with full functionality (Completed: Session 2)
  - Result: Complete EmotionalState system with all properties and thresholds
  - Files: EmotionalState.gd with rage_level, suppression_count, and signals
  - Tests: Debug keys 1, 2, 3 working correctly

- [x] Fixed signal connection issues (rage_changed -> rage_level_changed, etc.) (Completed: Session 2)
  - Result: All signal naming conventions standardized across system
  - Files: EventBus.gd and all connected scripts
  - Tests: Signal emission and reception working

- [x] Added suppression_count property to EmotionalState (Completed: Session 2)
  - Result: Tracking system for emotional suppression events
  - Files: EmotionalState.gd with proper signal emission
  - Tests: Property updates correctly

- [x] Created visual UI meter scenes (rage_meter.tscn, reservoir_meter.tscn, game_hud.tscn) (Completed: Session 2)
  - Result: Basic UI meter scenes created in Godot editor
  - Files: UI meter .tscn files with ProgressBar components
  - Tests: Scenes load and display

- [x] Fixed Tween node issues (Godot 4 uses create_tween() dynamically) (Completed: Session 2)
  - Result: Proper Godot 4 tween implementation throughout codebase
  - Files: All scripts using tweens updated to create_tween()
  - Tests: Animations working without errors

- [x] Attempted multiple fixes for UI meter display issues (Completed: Partial)
  - Result: UI meters functional but with display positioning issues
  - Files: rage_meter.gd, reservoir_meter.gd, game_hud.gd
  - Tests: Meters update values but have visual overlap/cutoff problems

- [x] Simplified UI meters to basic functionality (removed complex effects) (Completed: Session 2)
  - Result: Streamlined UI to core functionality for stability
  - Files: All UI meter scripts simplified to VBoxContainer + Label + ProgressBar
  - Tests: Basic functionality working, display issues remain

## üìã PENDING (Priority Order)
1. [ ] Create fade transition scenes for scene changes
   - Why: Required for Week 3-4 scene systems
   - Depends on: Basic scene management working

2. [ ] Create base dialogue UI components (dialogue box, choice buttons)
   - Why: Core gameplay mechanic for all scenes
   - Depends on: UI system stabilization

3. [ ] Implement debug overlay panel with interactive sliders
   - Why: Essential for efficient testing and development
   - Depends on: UI positioning issues being resolved

4. [ ] Test save/load system functionality
   - Why: Week 1-2 completion requirement
   - Depends on: Game states being fully testable

5. [ ] Begin Week 3-4 Scene Systems development
   - Why: Next major phase of development
   - Depends on: Foundation systems being complete

## üîç RECOVERY CONTEXT
### Currently Working On
- **Task**: Session transition and priority setup for Week 3-4
- **File**: .claude/todos/current.md
- **Line**: Updating session documentation
- **Problem**: Need to properly archive Session 2 and set up for next phase
- **Solution**: Document all progress, issues, and prepare for scene systems work

### Key Decisions This Session (Session 2 Summary)
- 10:00: Completed EmotionalState resource system with full signal integration
- 11:15: Fixed all player controller conflicts and state machine issues
- 13:30: Created visual UI meter scenes but encountered display positioning problems
- 15:45: Simplified UI approach to focus on core functionality over effects
- 17:00: Identified need for complete UI positioning redesign in future session

### Files Modified (Session 2)
- `src/resources/EmotionalState.gd` - Complete resource implementation
- `src/scripts/entities/player/player_controller.gd` - Fixed naming conflicts
- `src/scripts/ui/meters/rage_meter.gd` - Multiple fixes for display issues
- `src/scripts/ui/meters/reservoir_meter.gd` - Simplified implementation
- `src/scripts/ui/hud/game_hud.gd` - Positioning attempts and simplification
- `src/scenes/ui/meters/rage_meter.tscn` - Visual meter scene creation
- `src/scenes/ui/meters/reservoir_meter.tscn` - Visual meter scene creation
- `src/scenes/ui/hud/game_hud.tscn` - HUD layout scene

### Commands to Resume
```bash
# If session interrupted, run these:
cd /Users/matt/Projects/randos-reservoir

# Continue with Godot editor:
godot project.godot

# Test current state:
# 1. Player movement: WASD/arrows (Working ‚úÖ)
# 2. Run mode: Hold Shift (Working ‚úÖ)
# 3. Debug keys: 1,2,3 for emotional states (Working ‚úÖ)
# 4. UI meters: Partially visible but positioning issues (‚ö†Ô∏è)
```

## üéØ Definition of Done for Current Task
- [ ] Session 2 archived to .claude/todos/archive/ with timestamp
- [ ] Current session priorities set for Week 3-4 Scene Systems
- [ ] UI meter display issues documented for future resolution
- [ ] Next session ready with clear starting point

## üìù Session Notes (Session 2 Summary)
- Foundation Systems (Week 1-2) now 95% complete - still ahead of schedule
- Player movement and emotional state system fully functional
- Core architecture solid and ready for scene systems development
- UI meter functionality working but needs complete visual redesign later
- Debug controls excellent - development workflow very efficient
- EmotionalState resource system robust and extensible

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Issues (Current Known Issues)
- [ ] HUD display has overlap/positioning problems
  - Tried: Multiple positioning approaches, anchor adjustments, margin modifications
  - Need: Complete UI layout redesign approach

- [ ] UI meters partially cut off screen despite positioning attempts  
  - Tried: Canvas layer adjustments, viewport sizing, container anchoring
  - Need: Investigation into Godot UI best practices for HUD layout

- [ ] Progress bars and labels not displaying properly within viewport
  - Tried: Various container types, sizing modes, anchor points
  - Need: Study reference implementation or tutorial for proper HUD design

## üîú Next Session Priority
Starting Week 3-4 Scene Systems:
1. Create fade transition system (independent of UI issues)
2. Build dialogue UI components (can be done in isolation)
3. Set up debug overlay with sliders (after UI positioning resolved)
4. Test save/load functionality 
5. Begin actual scene content creation

## üìä Current Development Status

### Week 1-2: Foundation Systems ‚úÖ (95% Complete - Excellent Progress)

- [x] UI meter functionality (core) ‚úÖ

**REMAINING (5%):**
- [ ] UI meter visual positioning (known issue, not blocking)
- [ ] Save/load system testing (ready for implementation)
- [ ] Transition effects (ready to begin)

### Week 3-4: Scene Systems (Ready to Begin ‚úÖ)

- [ ] Dialogue system foundation
  - [ ] Dialogue box UI
  - [ ] Choice button system
  - [ ] Dialogue controller
- [ ] Save system implementation
- [ ] Audio manager testing
- [ ] Visual effects (screen shake, overlays)

### Technical Debt & Future Items
- **UI Positioning System**: Needs complete redesign (not blocking core development)
- **Complex UI Effects**: Removed for stability, can be added later
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor during scene system development
- **Visual Polish**: Schedule for Week 13-14 as planned

## üöÄ Session 3 Starting Points
1. **Immediate Goal**: Scene transition system (independent of UI issues)
2. **Core Focus**: Dialogue system foundation
3. **Testing Priority**: Save/load system functionality
4. **Architecture**: Build on solid foundation established in Sessions 1-2

---

**Session 2 Status**: Excellent progress with functional core systems. UI display issues documented but not blocking core development. Ready to proceed with Week 3-4 Scene Systems.
