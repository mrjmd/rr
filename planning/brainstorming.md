Brainstorming: Game Mechanics & Magical Realism

A 2D top-down game with limited mobility, focused on environmental storytelling and dialogue. The mechanics are designed to reinforce the core themes of dissociation, avoidance, repressed emotion, and the difficult search for authentic connection.
1. The Core Loop: Managing Internal State

The central challenge is not to defeat monsters, but to stay present. The player manages three interconnected meters that are often hidden or represented metaphorically.

    The Dissociation Meter: This is the primary mechanic. As tension rises, or when choosing avoidant actions, this meter fills.

        Stage 1 (Partial): The world becomes slightly muted, dialogue options for vulnerability may flicker or become harder to select.

        Stage 2 (Full Dissociation): All dialogue options disappear. The player can still walk around, but cannot meaningfully interact. The world is heavily filtered (audio muffled, colors desaturated). The player is trapped in their own head.

        The "Grounding" Mini-Game: To escape full dissociation, the player must perform a "grounding" action. This could involve focusing on an object (like their daughter), walking outside into the oppressive heat (see below), or correctly completing a simple rhythm-based breathing exercise. Success lowers the meter and restores interaction.

    The Rage Meter: Fills when the player chooses people-pleasing options or is subjected to triggering family dynamics.

        The "Leak": When full, the player loses control and a "leak" occursâ€”an involuntary sarcastic remark, a passive-aggressive action, or a harsh internal monologue that colors the screen. This action will always have negative consequences on the family's emotional state, making connection harder.

    The Connection/Vulnerability Meter: This is the "goal" meter. It fills only when the player is present (low dissociation) and successfully chooses a vulnerable dialogue option. Filling this meter is how you "win" encounters and unlock deeper story elements or other characters' perspectives.

2. The Environment: A Hostile Landscape, Inside and Out

    The House as a Living Entity:

        Emotional Weather: Tense conversations cause hallways to darken and lengthen; rare moments of connection cause sunlight to briefly appear.

        "Unspoken Rule" Barriers: The father's bedroom is a "no man's land," its door a shimmering barrier of dread. A player trying to enter might be physically pushed back by an unseen force until the mother grants "permission" by announcing a crisis.

        Memory Hotspots (Punctuated Moments): Used sparingly. Touching the brother's ambulance might trigger a vivid, playable flashback to his suicide attempt, re-contextualizing his current behavior. These are rare, high-impact events.

    External Pressure: The Florida Heat: "Out of the frying pan, into the fire."

        Leaving the house to escape emotional tension is a trade-off. A "Heat" meter appears on screen and begins to drain rapidly. When it's empty, the player is forced back inside. This makes escape a temporary, tactical choice, not a solution.

3. Catalysts & Obstacles: The People

    The Multi-Perspective "Rashomon" System: The core narrative engine. Playing through key scenes from different perspectives is the only way to get the full story. The ultimate goal is to embody each character, moving past judgment and into the grief of their shared, tragic reality.

    The Granddaughter ("The Oracle"): She is the emotional barometer. If she starts crying for no apparent reason, it's a sign that the room's unspoken tension has become unbearable. Her needs (napping, feeding) create mandatory scenes, forcing characters together.

    The Chaos Layer: The Sister's Children: When the four nieces/nephews arrive, the game state changes.

        The noise and chaos cause the player's Dissociation and Rage meters to fill passively.

        All "Vulnerable" dialogue options become disabled. The only available interactions are small talk and functional requests. They are the ultimate tool of collective family avoidance, making deep connection impossible.
