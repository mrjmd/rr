The Protagonist (Middle Son)

    Archetype: The Golden Peacemaker

    Core Pattern: People-pleasing, Avoidance, Repressed Rage

    Internal World: At 42, he's in the midst of a deep, painful reckoning with his childhood patterns. Having been the "golden child" who could do no wrong (by virtue of being a world-class deceiver), he is now trying to integrate his shadow and learn to express his immense, repressed anger in a healthy way. This week is a crucible for him, forcing him to confront the very system that created his coping mechanisms.

    Key Object: His 14-month-old daughter. She is both a shield (an excuse to disengage) and a mirror (reflecting the vulnerability and needs he was never allowed to express).

    Shadow: His masterful deception isn't just about lying; it's about creating entire realities to protect himself. He fears that if he stops managing everyone's perceptions, the entire family structure will shatter, and it will be his fault.

The Father

    Archetype: The Fallen Patriarch

    Core Pattern: Resignation, Repressed Anger, Spiritual Bypassing

    Internal World: A former Southern Baptist missionary, a man of immense physical and spiritual conviction, now trapped in a body ravaged by 30+ years of Multiple Sclerosis. He is wheelchair-bound, incontinent, and in chronic pain. He expresses a desire for God to take him home, but this piety masks a deep, simmering rage at his own helplessness and a profound sense of abandonment.

    Key Object: His wheelchair and the suprapubic catheter. They are the tangible, daily symbols of his prison and the loss of his agency.

    Shadow: He uses his faith as a shield against his own despair. By framing his suffering as "God's will," he avoids confronting the terrifying reality that he has simply given up, making him a passive, tragic figure rather than an active participant in his own life.

The Mother

    Archetype: The Agreeable Caretaker

    Core Pattern: Radical Agreeableness, Conflict Avoidance, Enabling

    Internal World: The sweetest, kindest, most gentle person imaginable, and his full-time caretaker. Her entire identity is built around service and maintaining a pleasant emotional atmosphere. However, this agreeableness is a survival strategy; she will say anything to anyone to avoid conflict, making her promises and reassurances untrustworthy.

    Key Object: The Bible. It is both her genuine source of strength and comfort, and a tool she uses to deflect from difficult, worldly problems that can't be solved with a simple prayer.

    Shadow: Her sweetness is a form of control. By never having a dissenting opinion, she forces others into the position of being the "difficult one" and absolves herself of the responsibility of holding boundaries or facing uncomfortable truths.

The Brother (Oldest Son)

    Archetype: The Martyr-Savior

    Core Pattern: Self-Sacrifice, Cynicism, Unresolved Anger

    Internal World: Morbidly obese and grappling with a deep-seated martyr complex. The former "wild child" who absorbed the family's overt chaos, he has now swung to the opposite extreme, positioning himself as the one who will save everyone, even if it destroys him. He is deeply cynical and, like his father, seems to have given up on the possibility of personal happiness.

    Key Object: His old, black ambulance converted into an RV. A rescue vehicle that is itself in a state of disrepair, it is the perfect metaphor for his identityâ€”he is built to save others but is fundamentally broken down himself.

    Shadow: His "selflessness" is a way to feel essential and needed while avoiding the terrifying work of building a life for himself. By focusing on others' problems, he never has to face his own.

The Sister (Youngest Daughter)

    Archetype: The Sheltered Princess

    Core Pattern: Fragility, Immaturity, Overwhelm

    Internal World: Lives on a farm with her husband and four adopted children, surrounded by a menagerie of animals. While this appears idyllic, it's a manifestation of a deep need to nurture and control her immediate environment. She feels perpetually overwhelmed by the world outside her sanctuary.

    Key Object: Her phone, a portal to the political anxieties that consume her and a barrier she uses to block out family members who don't validate her reality.

    Current Stressors (Critical Context):

        The Secret Plan: She is in a state of extreme distress over the political climate (specifically, Donald Trump's presidency) and is secretly formulating a plan to move her entire family out of the country. This is a source of immense, isolating anxiety that she refuses to discuss with the family.

        The Ailing Horse: She is the caretaker for an old, ailing horse that belonged to a dear friend who died of COVID ~9 months prior. The friend's husband is scheduled to visit during the week to say a final goodbye and approve the horse being put down. This looms over her as a constant, tangible reminder of grief and a source of logistical and emotional pressure.

    Shadow: Her fragility is a shield. By being the one who is always overwhelmed, she absolves herself of the responsibility of showing up for anyone else's emotional needs. Her world is a carefully constructed bubble, and she panics when it's threatened.
