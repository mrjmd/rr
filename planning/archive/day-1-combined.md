# Vertical Slice: Day 1 - Prologue, Arrival & The Drive

**Working Title:** Rando's Reservoir

## Phase 0: The Gauntlet (Opening Credits Montage)

### Concept
A series of short, stylized vignettes depicting the stress of solo air travel with a baby. The player has minimal, often futile, agency. The goal is to build a baseline of stress before the first major scene.

**Setting:** A series of rapid, stylized cuts showing the exhausting journey to Florida.

**Mechanic:** This is a non-interactive or micro-interactive sequence. A baseline level of the Rage Meter appears and slowly fills with each vignette. The player is being pre-loaded with Rando's stress.

**Sound Design:** Muted airport announcements, the drone of a plane, snippets of a crying baby, overlaid with a tense, atmospheric musical track.

### Vignette 1: Curbside Chaos / The Curbside Drop-off

**Visual:** Rando stands on the airport curb as his ride pulls away. He is surrounded by a large checked bag, a folded stroller, and the baby in a carrier. Struggling to unload and organize everything while holding the baby.

**Micro-Interaction:** A "balancing" mini-game. The player must quickly click highlighted spots on the luggage pile to "steady" it as they try to get everything organized. It's a frustrating plate-spinning exercise. Alternatively, a quick Tetris-like inventory management game.

**Internal Monologue:** *Just get inside. Just get inside.*

**Outcome:** The player wrangles the gear. The Rage Meter appears for the first time, filling to 5% from the initial struggle.

### Vignette 2: Security Line

**Visual:** A static image of the airport security line. Rando is trying to unfold the stroller with one hand while holding the baby carrier. A long, slow-moving line where Rando has to collapse the stroller, take off his shoes, and pull out electronics, all with one hand.

**Micro-Interaction:** A prompt appears: `[Mash 'F' to Unfold Stroller]`. The player mashes the button. A progress bar fills agonizingly slowly, with frustrating "jamming" sound effects.

**Internal Monologue:** *Don't drop her. Don't drop the laptop. Don't make a scene.*

**Outcome:** The stroller finally opens. The Rage Meter rises to 10%.

### Vignette 3: The Family Restroom / The Delayed Flight

#### Version A: The Delayed Flight
**Visual:** Rando is sitting at the departure gate. The baby carrier is on the seat next to him. The flight information board in the background is visible.

**Micro-Interaction:** The time on the board flashes and the "ON TIME" text changes to "DELAYED 1.5 HOURS" (or "DELAYED 90 MIN"). The Baby's Fuss Meter appears for the first time, already half full. A prompt appears: `[Tap 'B' to Bounce Baby]`. The player must rhythmically tap the key to keep the meter from maxing out.

**Internal Monologue:** *There goes her nap. There goes my sanity.*

**Outcome:** The scene holds for a few seconds of tense tapping, then fades. The Rage Meter rises to 15%.

#### Version B: The Family Restroom Limbo
**Visual:** A shot of a "Family Restroom" sign, with a line of other parents waiting. A quick cut to the cramped, dirty interior for a diaper change.

**Internal Monologue:** *Please don't touch anything. Please don't touch anything.*

**Outcome:** The Rage Meter fills by another 5%.

### Vignette 4: The Gate Delay / In-Flight Turbulence

#### Version A: In-Flight Turbulence
**Visual:** A tight, claustrophobic view of Rando in an airplane seat, baby in his lap. The seatback in front is very close.

**Micro-Interaction:** A series of quick-time events. The baby's foot will drift towards the seat in front; a prompt `[Press 'W'!]` appears. Her hand will reach for the stranger's drink; a prompt `[Press 'A'!]` appears. Each miss raises the Fuss Meter and adds a small amount of Rage.

**Outcome:** After a tense sequence, the plane lands. The Rage Meter is now at 25%.

#### Version B: The Gate Delay
**Visual:** The departures board flickering from "ON TIME" to "DELAYED 90 MIN". The baby's nap schedule is visibly ruined. Rando paces endlessly in the crowded gate area.

**Internal Monologue:** *There goes her nap. There goes my sanity.*

**Outcome:** Rage Meter fills by another 10%.

### Vignette 5: Family Restroom / The In-Flight Battle

#### Version A: Family Restroom
**Visual:** A cramped, dimly lit family restroom. Rando is at a changing table.

**Micro-Interaction:** A simple, timed drag-and-drop puzzle to change a diaper before a timer runs out.

**Outcome:** Success. A brief moment of quiet. The Rage Meter stays at 25%, but the player feels the cumulative weight of the constant care tasks.

#### Version B: The In-Flight Battle
**Visual:** A tight, claustrophobic view from the plane seat. The baby is squirming. 

**Micro-Interaction:** A timed, "whack-a-mole" style micro-game where the player has to click on interactive points (a dangling toy, a bottle) to keep the baby's "Fuss Meter" from maxing out.

**Internal Monologue:** *Just stay calm. Don't kick the seat. Please don't kick the seat. Please don't scream.*

**Outcome:** Rage Meter fills by another 10%.

### Final Transition
A black screen with text: **"Her mom couldn't make it."** 

Then, fade in to the sound of cicadas and the bright, oppressive Florida sun.

**End Montage:** Fade to black. The screen reads: **OCALA, FLORIDA.**

**Player State:** When the player gains full control at the curbside, they are not starting from zero. They are exhausted, overstimulated, and their Rage Meter is already primed at 25%. The car seat isn't the start of the problem; it's the next one in a long line.

## Phase 1: Setup & The Slow Burn / The Approach

**Setting:** The sweltering heat of the Orlando airport parking garage. Player gains control of Rando. The Mother stands by her old Prius, fanning herself.

**Camera:** Top-down view. Rando, Mother, and baby carrier are next to a beat-up old Prius. The trunk is open with luggage. The back door is open, revealing the empty seat base.

**Visuals:** A heat-haze effect shimmers over the screen. 

**Initial UI:** A Heat Meter (a sun icon with a thermometer bar) appears at the top right of the screen. It starts filling slowly. The oppressive ambient sound of cicadas and distant traffic begins.

**Internal Monologue:** *God, it's hot. It hits you like a wall.* / *Okay, just breathe. It's hot, but you can do this. Don't start the week like this.*

**Player Action:** The player walks Rando to the open car door. An interact prompt appears over the car seat base (or the car seat sitting on the asphalt).

**Dialogue:** The Mother speaks, her text appearing in a box near her sprite: "Oh dear, I couldn't for the life of me figure out how that thing works. They make them so complicated these days."

## Phase 2: The Mini-Game & Escalation / The Puzzle

**Setting:** The view zooms in on the car's back seat. The car seat is now in the player's "hands."

**Player Action:** Player interacts with the car seat base. The view zooms in slightly. The mini-game begins.

### Mechanic
A simple but frustrating sequence puzzle. The player must click on three anchor points in the correct order. The correct order is not intuitive. Alternatively, a frustrating multi-step puzzle where the player must click and drag straps and buckles in the correct sequence. The UI is intentionally a bit clumsy to simulate the real-world awkwardness. The Baby's Fuss Meter appears as she starts to get restless in the heat.

**Internal Monologue:** *Okay, this strap goes... here? No, that's not right. Why won't this buckle fit?*

### First Failure
- A harsh "clank" sound effect plays. A red "X" flashes on screen.
- **UI Update:** The Rage Meter jumps from 25% to 40%. The Heat Meter's fill rate increases.
- **New UI:** The Baby's Fuss Meter (an icon of the baby's face, starting to frown) appears on the right. A soft cooing turns into a fussy whimper.
- **Internal Monologue:** *Seriously? Why is this so difficult? I can hear her starting to fuss. Just focus.*

### Second Failure / The Escalation
- Another "clank." The puzzle resets.
- **UI Update:** Rage Meter jumps to 70%. Heat Meter fill rate increases again. The sound of the Florida sun beating down becomes more intense. Baby's Fuss Meter turns yellow, and the whimpering gets louder.
- **Visuals:** As the Rage Meter fills past 50%, a subtle red tint appears at the edges of the screen. A faint, pulsing heartbeat is added to the sound mix.
- **Dialogue:** The Mother: "Is everything alright, honey? Don't you worry about us, just take your time." (This "helpful" comment makes the Rage Meter jump another 10%).
- **Internal Monologue (changes with Rage):**
  - (50% Rage): *Come on, you stupid thing. Just work.*
  - (70% Rage): *Take my time? Does she not hear the baby? Does she not feel the heat? Just... breathe.*
  - (75% Rage): *I'm going to throw this piece of junk into traffic.*

## Phase 3: The Tipping Point / The Breaking Point (The Core Choice)

### Third Failure
- A loud "CLANG." The puzzle resets again.
- **UI Update:** Rage Meter jumps to 95% (or hits 90%). It begins to throb with a red glow. The baby's fussing turns into the beginning of a real cry. The edges of the screen begin to pulse with a faint red tint.

### THE CHOICE
Time slows down. A large prompt appears over Rando's head: `[Hold R to Suppress]` or `[Hold SPACE to Suppress]`. The player has a few seconds to make a choice.

#### Path A: Don't Suppress / Let it Leak (Do Nothing / Rage Leak)
**The player does nothing. The Rage Meter hits 100%.**

**Action:** Rando's sprite performs a sharp, involuntary animationâ€”he slams his hand on the roof of the car. A loud BANG sound effect plays.

**Consequence:** The baby is startled and immediately starts crying loudly. The Fuss Meter maxes out. The Mother flinches, her sprite taking a small step back.

**Dialogue:** 
- Mother: "Rando! Oh, you've scared her. Please, just try to stay calm."
- Alternative: "Rando, please. You'll scare the baby."

**Outcome:** The Rage Meter empties. The puzzle becomes slightly easier for the next attempt. The player has a moment of release but has created a tense social atmosphere. An immediate, negative social consequence has occurred.

#### Path B: Suppress / Fill the Reservoir (Hold Key)
**The player holds the 'R' or 'SPACE' key.**

**Visual:** A sound of a deep, sharp inhale is heard. The red glow on the screen recedes. A visual effect like black ink being drawn inward appears around Rando. The pulsing red screen tint recedes.

**Action:** Rando's sprite straightens up, taking a controlled breath.

**Consequence:** The Rage Meter instantly drains completely. The Reservoir meter (a dark, watery bar at the very bottom of the screen) appears for the first time and slowly fills by 10%.

**Internal Monologue:** (Text is colder, more detached) *Fine. It's fine. I'm fine. Just get it done.*

**Outcome:** The player has "handled" the situation perfectly in his mother's eyes, but has now taken on the first measure of the game's long-term burden. The immediate crisis is averted. Rando appears calm. But a long-term cost has been paid.

## Phase 4: Resolution

Following the choice, the next click on the car seat works.

**Player Action:** The player successfully completes the puzzle. A satisfying "CLICK" or "CLUNK" sound effect plays.

**UI Update:** All meters related to the mini-game (Heat, Fuss, Rage) fade away or recede. A moment of exhausted relief.

**Action:** An automated animation plays of Rando buckling the baby into the car seat. The crying/fussing subsides.

**Dialogue:** The Mother: "Oh, wonderful! See, I knew you'd get it. You were always so good at these sorts of things."

**End Scene:** Fade to black, preparing for the next scene: "The Two-Hour Drive."

## Phase 5: The Two-Hour Drive (The Unspoken Revealed)

**Setting:** The interior of the Prius, driving down the highway.

### Part 1: The Surface

**Dialogue:** The scene begins with the safe, circular small talk that characterizes the family.

Mother: "So how is work going? Are you enjoying the new project?"

**Rando (Player Choice):**
1. "It's good. Busy, but good." (The simple, non-committal answer).
2. "It's actually really challenging. My boss is..." (An attempt to share, which is met with a placating, non-curious response from the Mother).

**Internal Monologue:** *She's not really listening. She's just making the sounds. It's okay. It's what she does.*

### Part 2: The Bombshell

**Dialogue:** After a pause, the Mother sighs, a sound weighted with significance.

Mother: "I probably shouldn't be telling you this... your sister doesn't want anyone to know. But... she's planning on leaving the country. Because of the election."

**Internal Monologue:** *What? Leave the country? What the hell is she talking about?*

### Part 3: The Critical Choice & Pattern Recognition

#### Choice 1: The Mediator / The Peacemaker
"Wow. That's... a huge decision. How are *you* holding up with that news?" 

(Manages his mother's emotions, deflecting from the core issue. The "peacemaker" role).

**Feedback & Consequence:** After the choice is made, a small, subtle text notification fades in and out at the bottom of the screen: **PATTERN: THE PEACEMAKER**. The immediate tension is diffused, but the opportunity for genuine connection is lost. The Reservoir meter remains unchanged.

#### Choice 2: The Analyst / The Intellectual Defense
"Is that even possible? What's the plan? Does she have a visa, a job lined up?" 

(Focuses on practicalities to avoid the emotional weight. The "intellectual" defense).

**Feedback & Consequence:** A text notification fades in and out: **PATTERN: THE INTELLECTUAL DEFENSE**. The conversation moves to logistics, successfully avoiding the emotional core. The Reservoir meter remains unchanged.

#### Choice 3: The Judge
"That's completely insane. Running away won't solve her problems." 

(Expresses direct judgment, creating immediate friction with the Mother who is trying to protect her daughter).

**Feedback & Consequence:** A text notification fades in and out: **PATTERN: THE JUDGE**. The Mother's sprite visibly stiffens. A tense sound stinger plays. Choosing judgment, even when it feels justified, reinforces the cycle of anger. The Reservoir meter fills by 5%.

### Dynamic Element
Throughout this tense part of the conversation, the baby might stir in the backseat. The Fuss Meter can reappear, forcing the player to make a choice: continue the intense conversation, or choose a new option: `[Soothe the Baby]`, which ends the conversation but leaves the tension unresolved.

### End Scene
The conversation eventually peters out into an uneasy silence. As they pull into the neighborhood, the Mother's phone buzzes. She shows Rando a text from the Father: "How did she do with you?"

**Internal Monologue:** *He was thinking about her. About Mom. That's... nice.* A small, quiet moment of warmth.

**Visual:** The car turns into the driveway. The garage door is open, revealing towering piles of boxes and junk.

**Internal Monologue:** *Welcome home.*

**Fade to Black.**

## Phase 6: Welcome Home (The Living Museum)

**Setting:** The front entryway of the house. The space is dimly lit and overwhelmingly cluttered.

**Sound Design:** The car's engine is replaced by the low hum of an old refrigerator and the oppressive quiet of a house holding its breath.

### Mechanic: Environmental Clutter
A new, passive meter appears: the **Overwhelm Meter**. This meter fills slowly whenever the player is in a cluttered common area, making the Rage Meter more volatile.

### The Greeting
The Father is in his wheelchair; the Brother is on the couch. As Rando enters with the baby, the Mother announces their arrival.

**Interaction:** Rando hugs his Father (*Internal Monologue: He feels so fragile. Just bones.*) and his Brother (*Internal Monologue: No eye contact. Nothing. It's like hugging a stranger.*). Neither acknowledges the baby unprompted.

### The Critical Choice
The silence hangs heavy. The Overwhelm Meter fills. What does Rando do?

#### Choice 1: Force Cheerfulness
"So! What's new? Catch me up on everything!"

**Feedback & Consequence:** **PATTERN: THE PEACEMAKER**. The attempt to fill the void fails. The Brother gives a one-word answer.

#### Choice 2: Focus on Logistics
"Okay, I need to find a place to set her down and get her stuff unpacked."

**Feedback & Consequence:** **PATTERN: THE DEFLECTOR**. A safe move that avoids engagement.

#### Choice 3: State the Need
"Brother, can you clear a space on the floor for her play mat?"

**Feedback & Consequence:** **PATTERN: DIRECT REQUEST**. A risky, unfamiliar action with unpredictable results.

### Environmental Interaction
The player must find a place for the baby. Clicking on surfaces reveals internal monologues about the clutter and filth.

### Resolution
The player is led to the guest room. The scene ends as Rando steps inside and closes the door, the muffled sounds of the house fading slightly, providing the first moment of relative peace since landing.
