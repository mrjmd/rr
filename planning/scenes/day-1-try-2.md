Vertical Slice: Day 1 - Prologue, Arrival & The Drive

Working Title: Rando's Reservoir
Phase 0: The Gauntlet (Opening Credits Montage)

    Setting: A series of rapid, stylized cuts showing the exhausting journey to Florida.

    Mechanic: This is a non-interactive or micro-interactive sequence. A baseline level of the Rage Meter appears and slowly fills with each vignette. The player is being pre-loaded with Rando's stress.

    Sound Design: Muted airport announcements, the drone of a plane, snippets of a crying baby, overlaid with a tense, atmospheric musical track.

    Vignette 1: The Curbside Drop-off

        Visual: Rando struggling to unload a large checked bag, a stroller, and a car seat from a car while holding the baby. A quick, frustrating micro-game of Tetris-like inventory management.

        Internal Monologue: Just get inside. Just get inside.

        Rage Meter: Fills by 5%.

    Vignette 2: The Security Line

        Visual: A long, slow-moving line. Rando has to collapse the stroller, take off his shoes, and pull out electronics, all with one hand while holding the baby.

        Internal Monologue: Don't drop her. Don't drop the laptop. Don't make a scene.

        Rage Meter: Fills by another 5%.

    Vignette 3: The Family Restroom Limbo

        Visual: A shot of a "Family Restroom" sign, with a line of other parents waiting. A quick cut to the cramped, dirty interior for a diaper change.

        Internal Monologue: Please don't touch anything. Please don't touch anything.

        Rage Meter: Fills by another 5%.

    Vignette 4: The Gate Delay

        Visual: The departures board flickering from "ON TIME" to "DELAYED 90 MIN". The baby's nap schedule is visibly ruined. Rando paces endlessly in the crowded gate area.

        Internal Monologue: There goes her nap. There goes my sanity.

        Rage Meter: Fills by another 10%.

    Vignette 5: The In-Flight Battle

        Visual: A tight, claustrophobic view from the plane seat. The baby is squirming. A timed, "whack-a-mole" style micro-game where the player has to click on interactive points (a dangling toy, a bottle) to keep the baby's "Fuss Meter" from maxing out.

        Internal Monologue: Just stay calm. Don't kick the seat. Please don't kick the seat. Please don't scream.

        Rage Meter: Fills by another 10%.

    End Montage: Fade to black. The screen reads: OCALA, FLORIDA.

Phase 1-4: The Car Seat Installation (The First Trial)

    Phase 1: The Approach

        Setting: The sweltering heat of the Orlando airport parking garage. Player gains control of Rando. The Mother stands by her old Prius, fanning herself.

        Visuals: A heat-haze effect shimmers over the screen. The Heat Meter appears in a corner and begins to slowly fill.

        Internal Monologue: God, it's hot. It hits you like a wall.

        Player Action: The player walks Rando to the open rear door of the car. An interact prompt appears on the car seat sitting on the asphalt.

    Phase 2: The Puzzle

        Setting: The view zooms in on the car's back seat. The car seat is now in the player's "hands."

        Mechanic: A frustrating, multi-step puzzle begins. The player must click and drag straps and buckles in the correct sequence. The UI is intentionally a bit clumsy to simulate the real-world awkwardness. The Baby's Fuss Meter appears as she starts to get restless in the heat.

        Internal Monologue: Okay, this strap goes... here? No, that's not right. Why won't this buckle fit?

    Phase 3: The Escalation

        Mechanic: Each failed attempt (a missed timed click, choosing the wrong strap) causes the Heat and Fuss meters to spike. In turn, the Rage Meter begins filling rapidly.

        Visuals: As the Rage Meter fills past 50%, a subtle red tint appears at the edges of the screen. A faint, pulsing heartbeat is added to the sound mix.

        Internal Monologue (changes with Rage):

            (50% Rage): Come on, you stupid thing. Just work.

            (75% Rage): I'm going to throw this piece of junk into traffic.

    Phase 4: The Breaking Point

        Mechanic: The Rage Meter hits 90%. The game pauses for a moment. A prompt appears over Rando's head: [Hold SPACE to Suppress]. The player has a few seconds to make a choice.

        Choice A: Do Nothing (Rage Leak)

            Visual: The Rage meter fills completely. Rando's character sprite performs an animation of slamming his hand on the roof of the car. The sound is sharp and loud. The Mother's sprite visibly flinches.

            Dialogue: Mother: "Rando, please. You'll scare the baby."

            Consequence: The Rage Meter empties. An immediate, negative social consequence has occurred.

        Choice B: Hold SPACE (Suppress)

            Visual: The player holds the key. A visual effect like black ink being drawn inward appears around Rando. The pulsing red screen tint recedes. Rando's sprite takes a sharp, controlled breath.

            Mechanic: The Rage Meter drains completely. The Reservoir meter appears for the first time at the bottom of the screen and fills by 10%.

            Consequence: The immediate crisis is averted. Rando appears calm. But a long-term cost has been paid.

        Resolution: Following the choice, the next click on the car seat works. A satisfying CLUNK sound plays. The Heat, Fuss, and Rage meters all recede. A moment of exhausted relief.

Phase 5: The Two-Hour Drive (The Unspoken Revealed)

    Setting: The interior of the Prius, driving down the highway.

    Part 1: The Surface

        Dialogue: The scene begins with the safe, circular small talk that characterizes the family.

        Mother: "So how is work going? Are you enjoying the new project?"

        Rando (Player Choice):

            "It's good. Busy, but good." (The simple, non-committal answer).

            "It's actually really challenging. My boss is..." (An attempt to share, which is met with a placating, non-curious response from the Mother).

        Internal Monologue: She's not really listening. She's just making the sounds. It's okay. It's what she does.

    Part 2: The Bombshell

        Dialogue: After a pause, the Mother sighs, a sound weighted with significance.

        Mother: "I probably shouldn't be telling you this... your sister doesn't want anyone to know. But... she's planning on leaving the country. Because of the election."

        Internal Monologue: What? Leave the country? What the hell is she talking about?

    Part 3: The Critical Choice & Pattern Recognition
        TheMediator

         "Wow. That's... a huge decision. How are *you* holding up with that news?" (Manages his mother's emotions, deflecting from the core issue. The "peacemaker" role).

        Feedback & Consequence: After the choice is made, a small, subtle text notification fades in and out at the bottom of the screen: PATTERN: THE PEACEMAKER. The immediate tension is diffused, but the opportunity for genuine connection is lost. The Reservoir meter remains unchanged.
        TheAnalyst

         "Is that even possible? What's the plan? Does she have a visa, a job lined up?" (Focuses on practicalities to avoid the emotional weight. The "intellectual" defense).

        Feedback & Consequence: A text notification fades in and out: PATTERN: THE INTELLECTUAL DEFENSE. The conversation moves to logistics, successfully avoiding the emotional core. The Reservoir meter remains unchanged.
        TheJudge

         "That's completely insane. Running away won't solve her problems." (Expresses direct judgment, creating immediate friction with the Mother who is trying to protect her daughter).

        Feedback & Consequence: A text notification fades in and out: PATTERN: THE JUDGE. The Mother's sprite visibly stiffens. A tense sound stinger plays. Choosing judgment, even when it feels justified, reinforces the cycle of anger. The Reservoir meter fills by 5%.

    Dynamic Element: Throughout this tense part of the conversation, the baby might stir in the backseat. The Fuss Meter can reappear, forcing the player to make a choice: continue the intense conversation, or choose a new option: [Soothe the Baby], which ends the conversation but leaves the tension unresolved.

    End Scene: The conversation eventually peters out into an uneasy silence. As they pull into the neighborhood, the Mother's phone buzzes. She shows Rando a text from the Father: "How did she do with you?"

    Internal Monologue: He was thinking about her. About Mom. That's... nice. A small, quiet moment of warmth.

    Visual: The car turns into the driveway. The garage door is open, revealing towering piles of boxes and junk.

    Internal Monologue: Welcome home.

    Fade to Black.

Phase 6: Welcome Home (The Living Museum)

    Setting: The front entryway of the house. The space is dimly lit and overwhelmingly cluttered.

    Sound Design: The car's engine is replaced by the low hum of an old refrigerator and the oppressive quiet of a house holding its breath.

    Mechanic: Environmental Clutter

        A new, passive meter appears: the Overwhelm Meter. This meter fills slowly whenever the player is in a cluttered common area, making the Rage Meter more volatile.

    The Greeting: The Father is in his wheelchair; the Brother is on the couch. As Rando enters with the baby, the Mother announces their arrival.

    Interaction: Rando hugs his Father (Internal Monologue: He feels so fragile. Just bones.) and his Brother (Internal Monologue: No eye contact. Nothing. It's like hugging a stranger.). Neither acknowledges the baby unprompted.

    The Critical Choice: The silence hangs heavy. The Overwhelm Meter fills. What does Rando do?
        ForceCheerfulness

         "So! What's new? Catch me up on everything!"

        Feedback & Consequence: PATTERN: THE PEACEMAKER. The attempt to fill the void fails. The Brother gives a one-word answer.
        FocusonLogistics

         "Okay, I need to find a place to set her down and get her stuff unpacked."

        Feedback & Consequence: PATTERN: THE DEFLECTOR. A safe move that avoids engagement.
        StatetheNeed

         "Brother, can you clear a space on the floor for her play mat?"

        Feedback & Consequence: PATTERN: DIRECT REQUEST. A risky, unfamiliar action with unpredictable results.

    Environmental Interaction: The player must find a place for the baby. Clicking on surfaces reveals internal monologues about the clutter and filth.

    Resolution: The player is led to the guest room. The scene ends as Rando steps inside and closes the door, the muffled sounds of the house fading slightly, providing the first moment of relative peace since landing.
