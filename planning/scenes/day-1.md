Vertical Slice: Day 1 - Prologue & The Car Seat Installation

Working Title: Rando's Reservoir
Phase 0: The Gauntlet (Opening Credits Montage)

    Concept: A series of short, stylized vignettes depicting the stress of solo air travel with a baby. The player has minimal, often futile, agency. The goal is to build a baseline of stress before the first major scene.

    Vignette 1: Curbside Chaos

        Visual: Rando stands on the airport curb as his ride pulls away. He is surrounded by a large checked bag, a folded stroller, and the baby in a carrier.

        Micro-Interaction: A "balancing" mini-game. The player must quickly click highlighted spots on the luggage pile to "steady" it as they try to get everything organized. It's a frustrating plate-spinning exercise.

        Outcome: The player wrangles the gear. The Rage Meter appears for the first time, filling to 5% from the initial struggle.

    Vignette 2: Security Line

        Visual: A static image of the airport security line. Rando is trying to unfold the stroller with one hand while holding the baby carrier.

        Micro-Interaction: A prompt appears: [Mash 'F' to Unfold Stroller]. The player mashes the button. A progress bar fills agonizingly slowly, with frustrating "jamming" sound effects.

        Outcome: The stroller finally opens. The Rage Meter rises to 10%.

    Vignette 3: The Delayed Flight

        Visual: Rando is sitting at the departure gate. The baby carrier is on the seat next to him. The flight information board in the background is visible.

        Micro-Interaction: The time on the board flashes and the "ON TIME" text changes to "DELAYED 1.5 HOURS". The Baby's Fuss Meter appears for the first time, already half full. A prompt appears: [Tap 'B' to Bounce Baby]. The player must rhythmically tap the key to keep the meter from maxing out.

        Outcome: The scene holds for a few seconds of tense tapping, then fades. The Rage Meter rises to 15%.

    Vignette 4: In-Flight Turbulence

        Visual: A tight, claustrophobic view of Rando in an airplane seat, baby in his lap. The seatback in front is very close.

        Micro-Interaction: A series of quick-time events. The baby's foot will drift towards the seat in front; a prompt [Press 'W'!] appears. Her hand will reach for the stranger's drink; a prompt [Press 'A'!] appears. Each miss raises the Fuss Meter and adds a small amount of Rage.

        Outcome: After a tense sequence, the plane lands. The Rage Meter is now at 25%.

    Vignette 5: Family Restroom

        Visual: A cramped, dimly lit family restroom. Rando is at a changing table.

        Micro-Interaction: A simple, timed drag-and-drop puzzle to change a diaper before a timer runs out.

        Outcome: Success. A brief moment of quiet. The Rage Meter stays at 25%, but the player feels the cumulative weight of the constant care tasks.

    Final Transition: A black screen with text: "Her mom couldn't make it." Then, fade in to the sound of cicadas and the bright, oppressive Florida sun.

    Player State: When the player gains full control at the curbside, they are not starting from zero. They are exhausted, overstimulated, and their Rage Meter is already primed at 25%. The car seat isn't the start of the problem; it's the next one in a long line.

Phase 1: Setup & The Slow Burn

    Camera: Top-down view. Rando, Mother, and baby carrier are next to a beat-up old Prius. The trunk is open with luggage. The back door is open, revealing the empty seat base.

    Initial UI: A Heat Meter (a sun icon with a thermometer bar) appears at the top right of the screen. It starts filling slowly. The oppressive ambient sound of cicadas and distant traffic begins.

    Player Action: The player walks Rando to the open car door. An interact prompt appears over the car seat base.

    Dialogue: The Mother speaks, her text appearing in a box near her sprite: "Oh dear, I couldn't for the life of me figure out how that thing works. They make them so complicated these days."

    Internal Monologue: (Text appears faintly at the bottom of the screen) Okay, just breathe. It's hot, but you can do this. Don't start the week like this.

Phase 2: The Mini-Game & Escalation

    Player Action: Player interacts with the car seat base. The view zooms in slightly. The mini-game begins.

        Mechanic: A simple but frustrating sequence puzzle. The player must click on three anchor points in the correct order. The correct order is not intuitive.

    First Failure:

        A harsh "clank" sound effect plays. A red "X" flashes on screen.

        UI Update: The Rage Meter jumps from 25% to 40%. The Heat Meter's fill rate increases.

        New UI: The Baby's Fuss Meter (an icon of the baby's face, starting to frown) appears on the right. A soft cooing turns into a fussy whimper.

    Internal Monologue: Seriously? Why is this so difficult? I can hear her starting to fuss. Just focus.

    Second Failure:

        Another "clank." The puzzle resets.

        UI Update: Rage Meter jumps to 70%. Heat Meter fill rate increases again. The sound of the Florida sun beating down becomes more intense. Baby's Fuss Meter turns yellow, and the whimpering gets louder.

    Dialogue: The Mother: "Is everything alright, honey? Don't you worry about us, just take your time." (This "helpful" comment makes the Rage Meter jump another 10%).

    Internal Monologue: Take my time? Does she not hear the baby? Does she not feel the heat? Just... breathe.

Phase 3: The Tipping Point (The Core Choice)

    Third Failure:

        A loud "CLANG." The puzzle resets again.

        UI Update: Rage Meter jumps to 95%. It begins to throb with a red glow. The baby's fussing turns into the beginning of a real cry. The edges of the screen begin to pulse with a faint red tint.

    THE CHOICE: Time slows down. A large prompt appears over Rando's head: [Hold R to Suppress].

        Path A (Don't Suppress / Let it Leak):

            The player does nothing. The Rage Meter hits 100%.

            Action: Rando's sprite performs a sharp, involuntary animationâ€”he slams his hand on the roof of the car. A loud BANG sound effect plays.

            Consequence: The baby is startled and immediately starts crying loudly. The Fuss Meter maxes out. The Mother flinches, her sprite taking a small step back.

            Dialogue: The Mother: "Rando! Oh, you've scared her. Please, just try to stay calm."

            Outcome: The Rage Meter empties. The puzzle becomes slightly easier for the next attempt. The player has a moment of release but has created a tense social atmosphere.

        Path B (Suppress / Fill the Reservoir):

            The player holds the 'R' key. A sound of a deep, sharp inhale is heard. The red glow on the screen recedes.

            Action: Rando's sprite straightens up, taking a controlled breath.

            Consequence: The Rage Meter instantly drains. The Reservoir meter (a dark, watery bar at the very bottom of the screen) appears for the first time and slowly fills by 10%.

            Internal Monologue: (Text is colder, more detached) Fine. It's fine. I'm fine. Just get it done.

            Outcome: The player has "handled" the situation perfectly in his mother's eyes, but has now taken on the first measure of the game's long-term burden.

Phase 4: Resolution

    Player Action: The player successfully completes the puzzle. A satisfying "CLICK" sound effect plays.

    UI Update: All meters related to the mini-game (Heat, Fuss, Rage) fade away.

    Action: An automated animation plays of Rando buckling the baby into the car seat. The crying/fussing subsides.

    Dialogue: The Mother: "Oh, wonderful! See, I knew you'd get it. You were always so good at these sorts of things."

    End Scene: Fade to black, preparing for the next scene: "The Two-Hour Drive."
