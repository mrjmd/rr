## Day 1, Scene 0: The Gauntlet (Opening Credits Montage)

**Concept:** A series of short, stylized vignettes depicting the stress of solo air travel with a baby. The player has minimal, often futile, agency. The goal is to build a baseline of stress and introduce core mechanics before the first major scene.

**Sound Design:** Muted airport announcements, the drone of a plane, snippets of a crying baby, overlaid with a tense, atmospheric musical track.

### Vignette 1: Curbside Chaos
- **Visual:** Rando struggles on the airport curb with a large bag, a stroller, and the baby in a carrier.
- **Micro-Interaction:** A frustrating "balancing" or "Tetris-like" mini-game to organize the luggage.
- **Internal Monologue:** *Just get inside. Just get inside.*
- **Outcome:** The **Rage Meter** appears, filling to 5%.

### Vignette 2: Security Line
- **Visual:** A long, slow-moving security line. Rando has to collapse the stroller, remove shoes and electronics with one hand.
- **Micro-Interaction:** `[Mash 'F' to Unfold Stroller]`. The progress bar fills agonizingly slowly.
- **Internal Monologue:** *Don't drop her. Don't drop the laptop. Don't make a scene.*
- **Outcome:** Rage Meter rises to 10%.

### Vignette 3: The Delayed Flight
- **Visual:** Rando at the departure gate. The flight board changes from "ON TIME" to "DELAYED 90 MIN".
- **Micro-Interaction:** The **Fuss Meter** appears. The player must rhythmically tap a key to keep the meter from maxing out as the baby's nap schedule is ruined.
- **Internal Monologue:** *There goes her nap. There goes my sanity.*
- **Outcome:** Rage Meter rises to 15%.

### Vignette 4: In-Flight Battle
- **Visual:** A tight, claustrophobic view from the plane seat. The baby is squirming.
- **Micro-Interaction:** A "whack-a-mole" style game where the player clicks interactive points (toys, bottles) to keep the Fuss Meter from maxing out.
- **Internal Monologue:** *Just stay calm. Don't kick the seat. Please don't kick the seat. Please don't scream.*
- **Outcome:** Rage Meter rises to 25%.

### Vignette 5: The Family Restroom
- **Visual:** A cramped, dirty family restroom during a diaper change.
- **Internal Monologue:** *Please don't touch anything. Please don't touch anything.*
- **Outcome:** A brief moment of quiet. The Rage Meter holds at 25%, emphasizing the cumulative weight of care tasks.

### Final Transition
1.  A black screen with white text: **"Her mom couldn't make it."**
2.  Fade in to the sound of cicadas and the bright, oppressive Florida sun.
3.  Fade to black. Text appears: **OCALA, FLORIDA.**

**Player State:** The player begins the first interactive scene with the Rage Meter already primed at 25%.
