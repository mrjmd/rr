## Day 1, Scene 2: The Two-Hour Drive

### Part 1: The Seating Choice
- **Action:** The player is presented with a choice: `[Sit in the back with the baby]` or `[Sit in the front with Mom]`.
- **Consequences:**
    - **Back Seat:** Allows direct management of the **Fuss Meter**. The baby is guaranteed to eventually fall asleep.
    - **Front Seat:** The player cannot soothe the baby, risking a spike in **Rage** and **Overwhelm** if she starts to cry.

### Part 2: The Transition
- **Action:** If in the back, the baby falls asleep after a short time. A new choice appears: `[Stay in the back]` or `[Move to the front seat]`.
- **Agility Moment:** If the player moves to the front, the Mother comments on their agility. 
    - **Internal Monologue:** *It felt good to be seen. A small, warm spark.*
    - **Mechanical Effect:** A small, one-time reduction in the **Reservoir** meter or a temporary "Grounded" status, rewarding the choice for connection.

### Part 3: The Conversation
- **Dialogue Flow:** The conversation begins. The player can ask about Dad first (triggering a small internal monologue of guilt) or Mom. The conversation then flows towards Rando's anxieties about his siblings, specifically being blocked on social media by his sister.
- **Mother's Role:** The mother is agreeable and validating, but Rando's internal monologue reveals his distrust: *I want to believe her. But I know she'll say the same thing to my sister. Whose side is she on? Everyone's. No one's.*

### Part 4: The Big Reveal
- **Dialogue (Mother, after a pause):** "I probably shouldn't be telling you this... your sister doesn't want anyone to know. But... she's planning on leaving the country. Because of the election."
- **Internal Monologue:** *What? Leave the country? What the hell is she talking about?*
- **Critical Choice:** The player is presented with choices that reveal their coping mechanisms.
    - **Choice 1 (The Peacemaker):** Focus on managing the mother's emotions. **Feedback: PATTERN: THE PEACEMAKER**.
    - **Choice 2 (The Intellectual):** Focus on practicalities to avoid the emotional weight. **Feedback: PATTERN: THE INTELLECTUAL DEFENSE**.
    - **Choice 3 (The Judge):** Express direct judgment, creating friction. **Feedback: PATTERN: THE JUDGE**.

### Part 5: The Father's Text & Conditional Dialogue
- **Action:** After the intensity of the reveal, the car's audio system interrupts with a robotic voice: *"New text from: Dad. 'How did she do with you?'"*
- **Conditional Dialogue:** The player's response options depend on their current emotional state.
    - **If `Overwhelm < 50`:** A vulnerable option is available: `[Say: "That's really sweet... he was thinking about you."]` This leads to a moment of connection and slightly lowers **Rage**.
    - **If `Overwhelm >= 50`:** This option is unavailable (grayed out or gone). The player is left with more cynical or neutral responses. An opportunity for connection is lost due to the player's internal state.

### Part 6: End Scene
- **Visual:** The conversation peters out as the car pulls into the driveway. The garage door is open, revealing towering piles of junk.
- **Internal Monologue:** *Welcome home.*
- **End Scene:** Fade to black.
