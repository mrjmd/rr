## Day 1, Scene 4: The Evening and The Dream

This scene follows immediately after the arrival and initial greetings.

### Part 1: The Ghosting
- **Action:** Immediately after the awkward silence is broken, the Brother stands up and announces he has to leave.
- **Dialogue (Brother):** "Well, I've got some things I gotta take care of."
- **Internal Monologue (Default Path):** The default reaction is one of pure judgment.
    - *Just like that, he's gone. No questions. No offer to help. Just... gone.*
- **Insight Pathway (Conditional):** This pathway is only unlocked if the player has made a specific "Connect" choice earlier in the day (e.g., the vulnerable response to the father's text in the car).
    - **Mechanic:** If the pathway is unlocked, the default monologue appears, but is then interrupted by a "Moment of Clarity" UI prompt (e.g., a screen flicker, a subtle sound, a `[Hold to Reflect]` button that appears for only a few seconds).
    - **Unlocked Monologue (If player catches the prompt):**
        - *He just runs. No offer to help...* (A beat) *...I get it. I've got my gym. He's got... whatever he runs to. We just use different exits.*
- **Outcome:** This establishes the Brother's avoidance pattern. By default, Rando judges it. If the player has earned it, Rando can have a painful moment of seeing himself in his brother's actions, turning judgment into empathy. Rando is still left to handle the logistics alone.

### Part 2: The One-Handed Burden (The Unpacking)
- **Setting:** Rando must now set up his daughter's guest room and his own. Both are filled with clutter.
- **Core Mechanic: The Clingy Baby:** Rando's daughter will not let him put her down. This is represented by a "Hold Baby" status that limits interactions.
    - **One-Handed Actions:** Rando can perform simple, one-handed tasks while holding the baby (e.g., opening a drawer, placing a single item of clothing).
    - **Two-Handed Actions:** To perform more complex tasks (moving a box, assembling the Pack 'n Play), he must put the baby down.
    - **Fuss Meter:** Putting the baby down starts a short timer on a **Fuss Meter**. Rando has a limited window to perform the two-handed task before the meter fills and he must pick her up again.
- **Gameplay Loop:** The player must manage this loop of: find a clear spot -> put baby down -> do a task -> pick baby up. This is a tense resource management puzzle where the "resource" is time before the baby fusses.
- **Outcome:** Successfully unpacking the essentials fills the **Overwhelm Meter** due to the cognitive load and cluttered environment.

### Part 3: The Salad of Solitude (The Evening Meal)
- **Setting:** The quiet, cluttered kitchen.
- **Action:** Rando, having missed lunch due to the flight delay, is hungry. He finds a bag of salad in the fridge and eats alone.
- **Mechanic:** This is a purely narrative scene. There are no meters. The goal is to reinforce the sense of isolation and the feeling of being a guest who must fend for himself.

### Part 4: The Conditional Sanctuary (Putting the Daughter to Bed)
- **Setting:** The daughter's darkened guest room.
- **Core Mechanic: Conditional Island of Peace:** This is the major "Island of Peace" for Day 1. Its outcome is determined by the player's actions during the "Car Seat Installation" scene.
- **Path A: Peaceful Bedtime (If no "Rage Leak" occurred):**
    - **Interaction:** A simple, calming rhythm game. The player presses keys gently in time with a lullaby as Rando feeds, sings to, and bounces the baby.
    - **Outcome:** Success. The baby goes to sleep easily. Rando feels a wave of love and connection. The **Reservoir Meter** is significantly reduced. This is a major reward for having managed his anger earlier in the day.
- **Path B: Stressful Bedtime (If a "Rage Leak" *did* occur):**
    - **Interaction:** The baby is unsettled and fussy, remembering the earlier outburst. The rhythm game is faster, more difficult, and the **Fuss Meter** is active.
    - **Outcome:** Success only means the baby is finally asleep. There is no feeling of peace, and no reduction in the **Reservoir Meter**. The opportunity for emotional reprieve was lost. Failure to complete the mini-game in time results in a small increase to **Rage** and **Overwhelm**.

### Part 5: The Dream Framework
- **Concept:** The specific content of the dream is TBD, pending user reflection. However, the *system* that governs the dream is defined here.
- **Transition:** After the baby is asleep, Rando retreats to his own guest room. He sits on the bed, and the screen fades to the dreamscape.
- **Dream Modifiers:** The dream's visuals and audio are directly influenced by the final meter stats from Day 1.
    - **High Rage:** Dream has aggressive, pulsating red tones. Sounds are sharp, distorted, and angry.
    - **High Overwhelm:** Dream is cluttered, chaotic, and noisy. The visual field may be claustrophobic.
    - **High Reservoir:** Dream is heavy, slow, and oppressive. Movement feels sluggish, and the audio is muffled and deep, as if underwater.
- **The Morning Reflection:**
    - **Mechanic:** Upon waking, the player is presented with three symbols from the dream (e.g., "The Heavy Water," "The Red Light," "The Floating Clutter" - these are placeholders).
    - **Choice:** The player chooses one symbol to "reflect on."
    - **Boon:** This choice provides a small, mechanical benefit for Day 2. For example:
        - Reflecting on "The Heavy Water" might grant a one-time resistance to gaining Reservoir points.
        - Reflecting on "The Red Light" might slightly increase the threshold for the next Rage Leak.
        - Reflecting on "The Floating Clutter" might make the Overwhelm meter fill 10% slower for the first half of the day.
