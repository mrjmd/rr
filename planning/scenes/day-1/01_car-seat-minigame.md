## Day 1, Scene 1: The Car Seat Installation

### Part 1: The Approach
- **Setting:** The sweltering heat of the Orlando airport parking garage. The Mother stands by her old Prius.
- **Visuals:** A heat-haze effect shimmers over the screen. The **Heat Meter** appears and begins to fill.
- **Internal Monologue:** *God, it's hot. It hits you like a wall.*
- **Dialogue (Mother):** "Oh dear, I couldn't for the life of me figure out how that thing works. They make them so complicated these days."
- **Action:** Player walks Rando to the open car door, where an interact prompt appears over the car seat base.

### Part 2: The Puzzle & Escalation
- **Mechanic:** The view zooms in. A frustrating, multi-step sequence puzzle to install the car seat begins. The UI is intentionally clumsy. The Fuss Meter reappears.
- **First Failure:** A harsh "clank" sound. Rage Meter jumps to 40%. Heat Meter fill-rate increases. Baby's fussing begins.
- **Internal Monologue:** *Seriously? Why is this so difficult? I can hear her starting to fuss. Just focus.*
- **Second Failure:** Another "clank." Rage Meter jumps to 70%. Heat and Fuss meters spike. A subtle red tint appears at the screen edges, and a faint heartbeat is added to the audio mix.
- **Dialogue (Mother):** "Is everything alright, honey? Don't you worry about us, just take your time." (This causes Rage to jump another 10%).
- **Internal Monologue (at 75% Rage):** *I'm going to throw this piece of junk into traffic.*

### Part 3: The Breaking Point (The Core Choice)
- **Third Failure:** A loud "CLANG." Rage Meter hits 90% and throbs with a red glow. The baby starts to cry.
- **THE CHOICE:** Time slows. A prompt appears: `[Hold R to Suppress]`.

#### Path A: Let it Leak (Do Nothing)
- **Action:** The Rage Meter hits 100%. Rando slams his hand on the car roof (Loud BANG).
- **Consequence:** The baby cries loudly. The Mother flinches.
- **Dialogue (Mother):** "Rando! Oh, you've scared her. Please, just try to stay calm."
- **Outcome:** The Rage Meter empties. The puzzle becomes slightly easier. An immediate, negative social consequence has occurred.

#### Path B: Suppress (Hold 'R')
- **Action:** A sharp inhale sound. The red glow recedes as Rando's sprite takes a controlled breath.
- **Consequence:** The Rage Meter drains instantly. The **Reservoir Meter** (a dark, watery bar) appears for the first time and fills by 10%.
- **Internal Monologue (colder, detached):** *Fine. It's fine. I'm fine. Just get it done.*
- **Outcome:** The immediate crisis is averted in the mother's eyes, but a long-term cost has been paid.

### Part 4: Resolution
- **Action:** The next attempt to install the car seat succeeds with a satisfying "CLICK." All mini-game meters fade. An animation plays of Rando buckling in the baby.
- **Dialogue (Mother):** "Oh, wonderful! See, I knew you'd get it. You were always so good at these sorts of things."
- **End Scene:** Fade to black.
