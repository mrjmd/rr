## Day 1, Scene 3: Welcome Home

### Part 1: The Arrival
- **Setting:** The dimly lit, overwhelmingly cluttered front entryway of the house.
- **Sound Design:** The car engine is replaced by the low hum of an old refrigerator.
- **Mechanic:** The **Overwhelm Meter** appears. It fills slowly in cluttered common areas, making the Rage Meter more volatile.

### Part 2: The Greeting
- **Action:** The Father is in his wheelchair, the Brother on the couch. Rando enters with the baby and hugs his Father and Brother.
- **Internal Monologue (Father):** *He feels so fragile. Just bones.*
- **Internal Monologue (Brother):** *No eye contact. Nothing. It's like hugging a stranger.*
- **Observation:** Neither acknowledges the baby unprompted.

### Part 3: The Critical Choice
- **Mechanic:** The silence hangs heavy as the Overwhelm Meter fills. The player must choose how to break it.
- **Choice 1 (Force Cheerfulness):** **PATTERN: THE PEACEMAKER**. The attempt fails to generate real conversation.
- **Choice 2 (Focus on Logistics):** **PATTERN: THE DEFLECTOR**. A safe move that avoids engagement.
- **Choice 3 (State the Need Directly):** **PATTERN: DIRECT REQUEST**. A risky, unfamiliar action.

### Part 4: Resolution
- **Action:** The player is led to the guest room. Clicking on surfaces reveals internal monologues about the clutter.
- **End Scene:** Rando steps into the guest room and closes the door. The muffled sounds of the house fade, providing the first moment of relative peace.
