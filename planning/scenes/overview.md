# Story Outline: The Eight Days

This document outlines the core narrative beats and associated gameplay mechanics for each day of the week.

## Recurring Systems: Systems of Reprieve

### The Gym
Rando can choose to escape to the gym during the baby's nap. This is a guaranteed way to lower the Rage Meter, but it's an act of dissociation (listening to podcasts, avoiding feeling) and it consumes precious time that could be spent with family, or running errands, creating a different kind of pressure.

### Islands of Peace
Small, unprompted scenes where Rando can observe a moment of genuine, simple connection, usually between his Mother and his daughter, Zora. Witnessing these moments slightly lowers the Reservoir meter, representing a sliver of hope and healing.

## Day 1: Arrival (The Pressure Cooker)

**Core Theme:** Immersion into the family system. The weight of unspoken secrets.

### Key Scenes

- **The Gauntlet:** The grueling airport and flight montage that pre-loads the player's stress.

- **The Car Seat Installation:** A high-pressure "tutorial" introducing the Heat, Fuss, Rage, and Reservoir mechanics.

- **The Two-Hour Drive:** A prolonged, trapped dialogue with the Mother. She reveals the bombshell about the Sister's secret plan to leave the country. The player is now burdened with this secret, which colors all future interactions.

- **Welcome Home:** Rando enters the cluttered, neglected house, introducing the Overwhelm Meter. The awkward, disconnected greetings with the Father and Brother.

## Day 2: The Farm (Sweet Avoidance)

**Core Theme:** The performance of a happy family activity under a cloud of unspoken grief and anxiety.

### Key Scene: Visiting the Sister's farm

- **Mechanic:** This is an "Island of Peace" activity, but a fragile one. The act of playing with the animals and kids keeps the meters stable.

- **Atmospheric Pressure:** The visit takes place under the shadow of the Sister's ailing horse. Knowing about her secret plan to leave and her impending grief over the horse reframes the entire scene. Her "sweet avoidance" is a desperate coping mechanism the player is now privy to.

## Day 3: The BBQ (The Rupture)

**Core Theme:** The failure of a planned moment of connection, leading to an emotional outburst.

### Key Scene: The brother-in-law accidentally wakes the sleeping baby

- **The Trigger:** Rando was promised a rare hour of adult time, which is now gone. The Rage Meter spikes dramatically.

- **The Aftermath:** Rando has a passive-aggressive "Rage Leak" at his brother-in-law. This is followed by a wave of guilt and remorse, but also a secret, shameful relief at now having a "valid" excuse (the baby) to avoid engaging with the family. This explores the complex, paradoxical nature of his avoidance.

## Day 4: The Pool (A Fragile Truce)

**Core Theme:** A moment of shared, low-stakes activity that creates temporary peace.

### Key Scene: The family gathers at the neighbor's pool

- **Mechanic:** Rando is the only adult in the water with the kids. This is another form of "sweet avoidance," but a communal one. Being physically separate from the Father lowers the ambient tension for everyone. The Overwhelm Meter recedes.

- **Atmosphere:** A rare moment where the family isn't in the cluttered house. The open air provides a brief illusion of freedom, even though no real connection is happening.

## Day 5: The Road Not Taken

**Core Theme:** The impossibility of connection due to ingrained patterns and overwhelming circumstances.

### Key Scenes

- **The Olive Branch:** The Brother extends his version of an invitation to connect: a trip to a shooting range. It is an act of care, but it is completely disconnected from the reality of Rando's responsibilities (the baby, his own need for reprieve).

- **The Avoidance:** Rando is unable to be direct. He gives a non-committal answer and then announces he's going to the gym, effectively rejecting the offer without ever acknowledging its meaning. A key moment of failed connection.

- **The Canceled Trip:** The plan for Rando and his Mom to visit their grandmother (a 4-hour drive) collapses when the Brother gets overwhelmed and backs out of watching the Father. This shows the fragility of the entire family system.

## Day 6: The Crisis

**Core Theme:** The intrusion of brutal, undeniable reality.

### Key Scene: The Father's suprapubic catheter fails

- **Mechanic:** The day's plans are completely derailed. The player is trapped in the house. The Overwhelm Meter is maxed out. An emergency nurse must be called.

- **Atmosphere:** This event forces everyone to confront the stark, ugly reality of the Father's condition, stripping away all pretenses of a normal family visit. It's a recurring event, highlighting the endless, grinding nature of their situation.

## Day 7: The Birthday (The Final Fracture)

**Core Theme:** The family's inability to hold space for anyone's needs.

### Key Scene: The nephew's 10th birthday party and Indian food feast

- **The Incident:** The nephew is excitedly describing a gift. The baby starts crying, and the adults' attention immediately shifts to her.

- **The Reaction:** The Sister, already stretched thin by her secret anxieties and grief, becomes visibly upset that her son's moment was stolen. It is the final, small cut that reveals the family's complete emotional bankruptcy.

## Day 8: The Departures

**Core Theme:** The profound sadness of unspoken goodbyes.

### Key Scenes

- **The Sister's Goodbye:** A scene heavy with unspoken emotion. The Sister holds the baby for the first time, a moment of connection that is immediately followed by the family unit fracturing again as they drive away. The player knows she cried all the way home. Rando is too dissociated to cry.

- **The Final Morning:** A series of quiet, tragic vignettes:
  - A stiff, formal goodbye with the Brother, layered with unsaid "I love yous."
  - Hugging the Father's emaciated body, a moment of pure grief for the man he was.
  - Saying goodbye to the Mother, leaving her alone to carry the immense burden.

- **The Drive Away:** The final two-hour drive back to the airport, a quiet, somber bookend to the arrival.
