# Technical Specifications Directory

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Read This First

### Scope Reality Check
Before diving into specs, understand that the current game design is **extremely ambitious**. This directory contains specifications for both:
1. **MVP Path** (Recommended) - What you should actually build first
2. **Full Vision** - The complete game as currently conceived

**Start with MVP. Always.**

## Specification Standards

Every specification MUST include:

### 1. Reality Check Section
- **Complexity Rating**: 1-5 (1=trivial, 5=extremely complex)
- **Implementation Time**: Realistic estimate with buffer
- **Dependencies**: What must exist first
- **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong

### 2. Definition of Done
- Concrete, testable success criteria
- Performance benchmarks
- User experience requirements

### 3. Alternatives Considered
- Simpler approaches that were rejected and why
- What we're NOT building (equally important)

### 4. Testing Strategy
- How we'll know it works
- Edge cases to handle
- Performance testing approach

## How to Use These Specs

1. **Start with `/mvp/core-loop.md`** - Understand the simplest version
2. **Read `/mvp/scope.md`** - Know what you're NOT building yet
3. **Pick ONE system** - Implement and test thoroughly
4. **Iterate** - Don't move on until current system is solid

## The Golden Rules

1. **If a spec is longer than 5 pages, it's too complex**
2. **If you can't test it manually in 5 minutes, it's too complex**
3. **If it requires more than 2 other systems, implement those first**
4. **If you're not sure it's needed for MVP, it's not**

## Red Flags in Specifications

Watch for these warning signs:
- "This system interacts with..." (more than 3 other systems)
- "Depending on player history..." (complex state tracking)
- "Multiple timers running simultaneously..." (performance risk)
- "Dynamically generated..." (scope creep)
- "AI-driven..." (probably unnecessary)

## MVP vs Full Vision

### MVP Focus (BUILD THIS FIRST)
- 1-2 core mechanics maximum
- 3 scenes to prove the concept
- 2 emotional meters at most
- No branching paths
- No save system (single session)
- Desktop only
- No audio/music
- Placeholder art is fine

### Full Vision (MAYBE YEAR 2)
- All planned systems
- 8 full days of content
- Complex branching narratives
- Full audio/visual polish
- Multiple platforms
- Achievements/meta progression

Remember: **Every successful game started as a simple prototype that was fun.**
