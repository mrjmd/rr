# Project Title (Working): Rando's Reservoir

## Logline
A man on a journey of self-reckoning brings his infant daughter home for a week-long family gathering—the first of its kind in over 20 years—forcing him to navigate the deep-seated patterns of avoidance, repressed anger, and fractured love that define his family, all while trying to stay present for his child.

## Theme
The tension between the deep desire for connection and the learned patterns of avoidance that prevent it. Can a person who has started to heal and see the "water" they swam in survive a total immersion back into it without drowning?

## Setting
The family home in Ocala, Florida. The world is small and claustrophobic: the house, the yard, maybe a neighboring property. The atmosphere is thick with unspoken history, the air humid with Florida heat and repressed emotion.

## Core Cast

- **The Player (Rando):** The Middle Son, "The Golden Child"
- **The Father:** The Patriarch, "The Sufferer"
- **The Mother:** The Matriarch, "The Peacemaker"
- **The Brother:** The Oldest Son, "The Wild Child"
- **The Sister:** The Youngest Daughter, "The Princess"
- **The Catalyst:** The Player's 14-month-old daughter, an innocent observer.

## Tone
Melancholy, tense, introspective, with flashes of rage, dark humor, and fragile hope. It should feel both hyper-realistic in its emotional detail and subtly surreal in its presentation.

## Core Conflict
The Player's internal battle to remain conscious, present, and authentic in an environment that demands dissociation, performance, and repression, versus the family's collective inertia pulling everyone back into their assigned roles.
