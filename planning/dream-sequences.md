# Planning: Dream Sequence System

## 1. Core Concept & Function

Dream sequences serve as a narrative and thematic bridge between days. They are not simple replays of memory but surreal, symbolic landscapes that reflect the player's subconscious state. Their primary function is to connect the player more deeply to the game's themes of dissociation, repressed emotion, and shadow work.

Key principles:
- **Unreliable Narrator:** Dreams are not necessarily factual memories. They can be distorted, symbolic, or entirely fabricated, reflecting the protagonist's internal reality.
- **Thematic Resonance:** The content of the dreams directly ties into the core mechanics (Rage, Reservoir, Overwhelm) and the overarching narrative.
- **No Direct Mechanical Benefit:** Dreams are not a place to actively lower stats or "win." They are for narrative and thematic immersion. The mechanical benefit comes from the *reflection* upon waking.

## 2. The Dream & Reflection Cycle

The system is built on a three-part cycle that occurs with each day-to-day transition.

### Step 1: The Trigger (End of Day)
Each day concludes when Rando enters a "safe" space to sleep (e.g., the guest room). The fade to black at the end of a day seamlessly transitions into the dream sequence for that night.

### Step 2: The Dream Sequence (Interactive Painting)
The dream itself is presented as an "interactive painting" rather than a fully playable level. The perspective may shift to be more disorienting (first-person, side-scrolling). The player has limited agency—they can typically look around and click on specific, symbolic objects to trigger a small visual or auditory event.

The structure of each dream is: **Authored Theme + Player-State Modifiers**.

- **Authored Theme:** Each night's dream has a core, scripted theme that advances the main story arc and explores a specific facet of the family's psychology.
- **Player-State Modifiers:** The player's final stats from the preceding day (Rage, Reservoir, Overwhelm) alter the *flavor, texture, and intensity* of the authored theme.

### Step 3: The Morning Reflection (The Mechanical Hook)
Upon waking, the player is presented with a black screen showing a few symbolic remnants from the dream they just experienced (as text prompts or faint images). The player chooses one symbol to reflect on.

This choice provides a small, tangible boon for the upcoming day, representing Rando's attempt to process his subconscious and influencing his mindset.

**Example Reflection Choices & Boons:**
- **Reflecting on a symbol of connection:** Might unlock a unique "Vulnerability" dialogue option for that day.
- **Reflecting on a symbol of pressure/burden:** Might grant a temporary resistance to gaining Overwhelm.
- **Reflecting on a symbol of avoidance:** Might allow for one "free" use of a deflective dialogue choice without the usual Rage penalty.

## 3. Proposed Dream Arc & Modifiers

This section outlines a potential thematic progression for the dreams across the week.

### Night 1: The Drowning
- **Core Theme:** Arrival, pressure, being submerged in the "water" of the family system.
- **Base Dream:** Rando is treading water in the deep end of the dark, quiet neighborhood swimming pool. He can see his family home in the distance, lights on, but it feels miles away.
- **Modifiers:**
    - **High Reservoir (Suppression):** The water is thick and heavy, like syrup, pulling him down. He feels an immense weight on his chest. The house is visible but sealed behind a wall of glass.
    - **High Rage (Outbursts):** The water is uncomfortably hot, almost simmering. The house in the distance has a single, angry red light pulsing in a window. The faint, distorted sound of an argument can be heard from it.
    - **High Overwhelm (Clutter):** The pool is filled with floating junk from the house—soggy cardboard boxes, an old armchair, broken toys—that bump into him and obstruct his view.

### Night 2: The Stage
- **Core Theme:** Performance, being watched, the "Golden Peacemaker" role.
- **Base Dream:** Rando is on a small, brightly lit stage. The family members are sitting in the dark audience, their faces indistinct. He's supposed to be performing but doesn't know his lines.
- **Modifiers:**
    - **High Reservoir:** He opens his mouth to speak, but only bubbles come out, as if underwater. The audience is completely silent, their judgment palpable.
    - **High Rage:** The stage lights are painfully hot and buzz loudly. The indistinct figures in the audience are heckling him with low, rumbling laughter.
    - **High Overwhelm:** The stage is cluttered with props from his life—a baby stroller, a laptop, his father's wheelchair—making it impossible to move. He keeps tripping over things.

*(This structure would continue for each night of the week, with themes evolving alongside the main narrative.)*
